# Welcome to the Policy Area Reference Guide

Welcome to the **Political Compass Categorization Team**! This guide is not only a training document but also a vital reference for our labeling work, which plays an important role in analyzing political representation. Through our work, we aim to map and analyze key policy areas reflected in recent Congressional sessions, enabling insights into how political messaging on social media aligns with legislative activity.

## Purpose and Impact of the Policy Area Labeling Project

### Project Goals and Usage

Our project centers on **categorizing posts and comments by policy area**. By associating political discourse with specific policy topics, we can identify trends, emerging concerns, and shifts in public focus.  These are then mapped to the specific bills individual congress members are on, and their individual effectiveness, to determine if they are representing the interests of their social online communities.  This will all be funnel into an interactive map dashboard. Here’s an overview of how your contributions fit into the broader goals:

1. **Understanding Representation**: Each label you apply to a post or comment reflects a specific policy area—like Health, Education, or the Environment—mirroring real-world legislative topics. This connection helps us assess whether there is alignment or disconnect between what constituents are talking about online and the bills currently being proposed or debated in Congress.

2. **Trend Analysis**: Over time, we will accumulate labeled data that enables us to track the popularity and intensity of various policy areas in social media discourse. By comparing these trends with Congressional data, we gain a better understanding of how public interest in different topics aligns with, or diverges from, legislative efforts.

3. **Assessing Politicians’ Alignment with Public Interests**: In the end, our analysis aims to answer the question: **Are politicians representing their constituents’ true interests?** By linking online discussions to Congressional activities, we can develop a clearer picture of whether elected officials are addressing the issues their constituents care about or if certain topics are neglected.

### How This Will Be Used

Each category you see in this guide has been carefully data-mined from legislative topics in recent Congressional sessions, ensuring relevance to today’s political climate. We’ve organized policy areas into **color-coded categories** to make it easy for you to identify and apply the appropriate label quickly.

Here’s a step-by-step look at what you’ll be doing and how it contributes to the larger project:

- **Data Labeling**: As you label each post or comment, you’re essentially tagging it with the policy area it pertains to. This labeling is a first step in structuring our dataset, allowing us to perform in-depth analyses and fine tune our machine learning models.  It's the soul of the model.  


- **Data Aggregation and Analysis**: Once the labeling is complete, our team will aggregate the data, examining which topics are most prevalent in public discourse. This aggregation will form the basis of our analysis on whether social media sentiment aligns with policy focus in Congress.  


- **Long-Term Policy Insights**: In the end, we hope to create a comprehensive policy report or dashboard, illustrating these connections. Our findings could support advocacy efforts, influence policy research, or provide insights into voter sentiment for policymakers and the public alike.  


This project’s success hinges on the accuracy and consistency of your labels, which is why this guide is here to assist you. By ensuring each post or comment is categorized correctly, you’re making it possible for us to provide meaningful insights into political representation and constituent interests.   

 
 
# General Instructions

To ensure consistency and accuracy in your labeling, please adhere to the following guidelines:  

1. **Don't be too critical:** Since these are online posts and comments, many may not directly scream out a 'policy' topic.  That's the whole point of this labeling -- can we infer that they are talking about a general subject.  

2. **Review Thoroughly:** Carefully read the entire content of each post or comment before assigning a label.  

3. **Select the Most Relevant Label:** Choose the policy area that best represents the main topic of the content.  

4. **Handle Ambiguity Appropriately:** If the content does not clearly fit into any specific category, select **"Other / Uncategorized."**  

5. **Primary Focus:** If multiple topics are present, prioritize the primary one that best encapsulates the content's main theme.  

6. **Use Tooltips:** Hover over each label in Label Studio to view a summary of its scope and use this as a quick reference.  

7. **Speed:** Don't spend too long on any one post or comment!  If you are unsure you can click Skip!
