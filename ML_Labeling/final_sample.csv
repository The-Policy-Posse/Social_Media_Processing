Alabama,1g3rtf7,Do you want early voting in Alabama?,"I just want to be able to vote early so I don’t have to stretch myself thin on one day. I know it’s selfish of me—to complain about having to go to the polls either before work and (only potentially) be late for work or go after work and be late getting home, cooking dinner, and other chores.


My employer does not provide time off for voting since we are open 8AM - 4:30PM, and the polls are open 7AM - 7PM. I understand that legally in Alabama, this is the situation for employers and voting leave:


Ala. Code § 17– 1–5

Time Off Allotted: An employee who is a registered voter and who provides reasonable notice to his/her employer, can take up to one hour off of work to vote in a primary or general election. The employer may specify the hour during which the employee may be absent for voting.


Wages: The statute does not specify whether the absence must be paid.


Exception: An employer is not required to provide voting leave if the employee’s shift begins at least two hours after the polls open or ends at least two hours before the polls close.


Notice Requirement: An employee must give reasonable notice to his/her employer.


The statute does not specify a penalty for employers failing to allow this.


—————————


It shocked me that Alabama is one of three states VS 47 OTHER STATES and even territories(!) that *do* offer early, in-person voting. I know Alabama’s not the best to its citizens, but jeez.


Would any of you support this? If not, other than the cost, what are your reasons for not wanting more convenience and time to vote?",1728942645,397,https://i.redd.it/a60b5hg5msud1.jpeg,228,ShylentJ,https://storage.googleapis.com/policy_posse_reddit_images/reddit_post_images/1g3rtf7.jpg,https://storage.googleapis.com/policy_posse_reddit_images/reddit_post_images/1g3rtf7.jpg,Crime and Law Enforcement,110.3,288

Alabama,1bk5k77,"History Education major here, I’m almost certainly moving after getting my degree.","For those not in the loop, S.B. 129 was signed into law yesterday by Gov. Kay Ivey, who herself has an education degree from Auburn. The bill seeks to defund DEI programs in public schools and places of higher education, ban the discussion of the intentionally vaguely worded “divisive topics”, etc. if you can think of something that may be affected by those incidentally, it most likely will be.

As a history education major, I can’t think of subject more affected by this than your liberal arts disciplines like social studies and language arts. This bill is anti-education, full stop. How are we supposed to allow our students the freedom to critically think about the past, or the stories they’re assigned, under the fear that we may be fired should a parent or the school board think we’re a toe over the line, can any professional feasibly work under those conditions? This bill is going to lead to a brain drain just like in Florida. Educators will leave, students concerned about their future will look to colleges/universities out of state, education standards in the state will only go lower. Alabama, for lack of a better word, will get dumber.  

But apparently that’s okay according to Alabama lawmakers, they’re okay with our home being a laughing stock. Well I’m not, I’ll get my degree next year and have to suffer through student teaching under this ridiculous law to spare the feelings of some of the most of unempathetic people in the country but after that I’m gone.

My husband and I were very interested in moving to Fairbanks AK or to even try out the bush (husband is a teacher). We did research and thought we could make it work. So, first, we visited. We are at the end of our one week stay here in Fairbanks and while this place is gorgeous and the wildlife and Northern Lights are super cool, we have found we wouldn't want to live here! 

This is in no way bashing Alaska. We give crazy kudos to those who do live here. I just can't handle the constant dark, and he can't handle the cold here. He grew up in ND, but this cold hits different. No fault to Alaska! 

So, please, no one just move here on a whim cause you think it'll be wild and cool and badass.

Alaska,1g08idk,How did Joe Biden use HAARP to create Hurricane Milton?,"Posting this here because I left a message on Nick Begich's answering machine and still haven't heard back.

Deputy party leader Marjorie Taylor Green recently confirmed on X (love you Elon!) what we all had suspected: Hurricane Milton was created by Democrats using advanced military technology to steal the election. As Alaskans, we know this means HAARP, just as we know the Republican party to be an irrefutable source of truth which should never be questioned.

But it still left me wondering how exactly do they create the hurricane using HAARP? According to wikipedia, HAARP is run by a well-known CIA/DoD front organization, the University of Alaska Fairbanks. It uses high frequency transmitters to excite the atmosphere. But my question is, how does exciting the atmosphere above Fairbanks cause a hurricane all the way down in Florida? And how do they make it so it only targets Republicans?

Alaska,1g29r05,Alaska has Ranked Choice Presidential Elections,"I want to remind everyone that we will have ranked choice voting for our presidential elections in Alaska. I personally think that's a big deal. We as voters can express more nuanced views of candidates and we can express dissatisfaction with mainstream candidates by pushing them down the list rather than sacrificing our ballots to make a point.

Let's say you're a libertarian or a green party voter, you can actually vote for your party as your first choice and then choose from the rest of the ticket. Your 3rd and 4th choice preference could really makes a difference this year.

I love that this system allows more nuance and more choice for voters. And it doesn't lock us in so much to the two party system. Alaska is a state where 63.9% of voters don't belong to one of the two major parties so I see this as a very good thing.

Vote no on 2 and be prepared to rank your presidential picks at the ballot box.

This was a major victory for same sex couples in Arizona. It's incredible how far we've come on this issue as over 10 years ago same sex couples in Arizona were denied the legal rights and protections that married couples have. This includes tax benefits and inheritance benefits. Same sex couples were also unable to make medical decisions for their partner, were denied visitation in hospital, and couldn't recieve healthcare coverage spousal benefits. They also faced significant barriers when it came to adoption or gaining parental rights, often being unfairly refused. The progress Arizona made is a testament to the decades of fighting from advocates and same sex couples. Despite the rampant persecution and violence that same sex couples faced thoughout the 20th century and early 21st century in Arizona they kept fighting. It's also a testament to the tens of thousands of people that have changed their mind in Arizona within the last 10 years.

Arizona,1dzutbz,4 month old dies after spending 4th of July at Lake Havasu,"This happen a couple of days ago, and it stills upsets me! Anyone else? I’m a mother to a 10 month old girl, we live in Phoenix and I could never imagine taking her outside for anything during this time of year. Sorry but how ignorant can these parents be? 

If no one knows the story, her name was Tanna Rae Wroblewski, she was 4 months old and she died due to exposure to the hot temperatures they were having at Lake Havasu. Sadly, her parents rather enjoy boating during 120 degree temps than protecting their baby. 

I understand now they have to deal with the death of their child and her funeral expenses. But I recently saw that someone created a ‘Go Fund Me’ for the family. On the description the organizer actually wrote “We will never understand why you had to leave so soon, you were just too perfect”. Really, we do know the reason. Adults can barely survive in 120 degree weather, how do they expect an infant to make it. 

I hope these parents are held responsible for her death. I can’t imagine what this little 4 month old baby girl was dealing with.

Arizona,1ck61a6,"Thank you, AZ. ","Hello Arizona! My husband & I are sitting in PHX, getting ready to go back to Ontario, Canada & honestly, I’m so sad to leave. 

We had such a lovely time in Arizona & will truly miss it. You might be thinking, of all places, why AZ? Well, coming from Ontario, we’re dealing with winter about 8 out of the 12 months & we wanted some warmth. We wanted good food, good experiences, good trails & some good energy. My brother also loves AZ & told us to try it out. 

So we did. No regrets at all. 

You people are so nice. Everyone is friendly, everyone is just so pleasant. We stayed in Scottsdale & visited Sedona, Mesa, Glendale, etc. We had amazing food, went to a shooting range, rented an ATV, went to many popular tourist attractions, etc. 

I’m in the airport, just truthfully depressed to be leaving. I’m going to miss the heat, the food, the energy. Everyone here is so much nicer than Canadians, & we’re the ones who are known to be nice! 

We didn’t deal with anyone unpleasant, I don’t know how to explain it but it just feels like everyone is happier??? 

Oh well, till next time AZ. I’ll definitely be back.

We have a beautiful state that goes from lakes and ponds to awesome ridges and mountains.

We are #3 as states are ranked, in education.

Our state taxes suck.... not gonna argue that. BUT, you ever been to other states and see what they provide? Abso-fucking lutely nothing.

Connecticut,1b7dqcw,Racism at cromwell high school,"
I’m a Sophomore (15) almost Junior. On my first day of Cromwell elementary school a kid dropped his jacket on the playground, I picked it up for him and handed it to him. He screamed “ah a black person!” And ran away from me. The next day I was called a sharpie pen. Since then I had been subjected to consistent harassment, assault and racism whether that be against me or those close to me. I moved from Hartford to Cromwell for better schooling and to escape harsh bullying but Cromwell would be absolute hell. The principal in the middle school would ignore the racism. I was a victim to racism by high schoolers, they would through food, (full on sandwiches), sharp pencils, water bottles (full) and would soon spit on my twin sibling and physical assault them. I would sit at her office every other week crying telling her what had happened and because I retaliated with swearing, and just swearing until people started to beat me. I was punished with in school suspension, every other week (for defending myself). the isolation causing me to develop anxiety. The time that me and my twin were assaulted and they were spit on, the principal said they couldn’t do anything because there was an inconsistency. My sibling moved the bag out of the way for the piece of crap for her to move past.  So we didn’t get justice because of that very minor detail that didn’t matter. I had people threaten my family and over multiple summers I’ve had people send KKK messages to my phone from unknown numbers, people came to my house and harassed me and my family. Here at the “Wonderful” Cromwell high school the N-word is said so freely and without consequence. They care more about the F word than the N word here, and other racial slurs. And when they do enforce it it’s only on the black students that say it, which is a whole other problem. People write it on our buildings and it is taken as a joke. I’m writing this because for the years I have dealt with this I don’t think I have ever processed it. And when I try sometimes I thought I deserved it or it wasn’t that bad or I cry a lot. Sometimes I zone out in class and think about it and it feels like I’m there. Other times I get depressed and think maybe racism is here to stay and nothings ever going to change and I will deal with this prejudice for the rest of my life, I actually used to think about ending it (Not anymore and I’m in therapy.)   because if this was high school what about when I leave and have to deal with more of it later, when it’s not the principal but the justice system and not just a racist white student but a proud boy or white supremacist. In writing this I’m trying to take back my power. This is my experience. My life and my post. Because when I’m gone I’m gone but I don’t want other people to come through and hurt the way I did. This is not only my experience but so many others. Please don’t let this go unnoticed Reddit. Cromwell, CT  loves covering things up with an assembly or a ten minute video.  So to Cromwell High-  who hates the F word more then a literal slur, Fuck your racism. 

Sincerely,
 a black teen you screwed up.

Connecticut,18sbeis,People from CT don't understand good things are in this State,"I've lived in Connecticut now for almost 2 years, and i have to say that listening to people who are originally from here complain about this state are just the worst. I grew up and Pennsylvania, I've lived in Kentucky, Tennessee, Texas, Pennsylvania, Florida, and Connecticut as an adult. Connecticut is by far the best place ive ever lived. Great schools, low in crime for the most part, great access to excellent healthcare, good infrastructure, and tons to do. Not to mention that almost everything is a short drive away. Heck even the VA Healthcare here is good and that is saying something.1 Sure the taxes are high, but you get what you pay for. I love it here. I have no plans to ever leave. If you dont like it feel free to leave, but i guarantee the grass is not greener.

Edit: A lot of positivity has come off this post for which im very happy to see. A couple of the negative things I've seen that i would like to question. 
First, job opportunities. Connecticut has a ton of them. I work for a large company with great benefits and salary. There are many jobs like mine open within my company and in the state.
Second: infrastructure, specifically roads, anyone who complains about roads in ct has never driven on i80 or i4 in pa and fl respectively two of the worst roads you'll ever find yourself on. i4 is one of the most dangerous stretches of interstate in the country, and i80 is in a level of disrepair that rivals a lot of dirt roads. 

One last positive about CT, specifically if you're a veteran. You can get a tax break on your vehicle and property taxes here, and if you have a disability rating, the discount is even better plus you can get your bachelors or graduate degree from a state school for FREE you dont even have to be a resident you just have to live in the state for a year. Not to mention that connecticut is super veteran friendly, more so than any other state I've ever lived in.

Connecticut,1eij2xd,The Millstone agreement is responsible for 77% of the Public Benefits part of your Eversource bill going up. I've study energy policy in CT - here's some additional info about the recent cost increase.,"I've seen a lot of misdirection and outright bullshit coming from our elected officials. The Republicans love touting that COVID shutoff moratoriums are causing your bill to go up. Yes, the moratorium shutoffs lasted a long time, and yes, they are contributing to the cost. About 20% of the increase, to be precise.

So why are Republicans claiming 20% of the increase and ignoring the other 80%? Well, there's a good reason, and it's called the Millstone agreement. For those unaware, Millstone Power Plant is in Waterford, and it's one of the only nuclear power facilities in New England. It generates as much as 37% of our state's power using nuclear - which, I'll add, is a good thing, as it's a zero-carbon, low-emission way to generate energy.

However, from 2017 to 2019, Dominion Energy, the owner of Millstone, engaged in a game of chicken with state legislators. They wanted the state to enter an agreement guaranteeing continued power purchases from Millstone for a decade to come, with vague threats of closing the plant otherwise. This led to the Millstone agreement ( [https://www.cga.ct.gov/2020/rpt/pdf/2020-R-0203.pdf](https://www.cga.ct.gov/2020/rpt/pdf/2020-R-0203.pdf) )

A majority of energy generated in Connecticut comes from natural gas, and back in 2017, it was significantly cheaper than nuclear. That's why Dominion was so concerned about getting cornered out of the market, and why they pushed the legislature to take action.

Former State Senator Paul Formica, a Republican out of Old Lyme whose district included the power plant, led the charge for the state to approve the Millstone agreement. The bill was Republican-led and received a split vote in 2017, with more Republicans than Democrats voting in approval. That agreement requires Eversource and UI to purchase a certain amount of the energy generated by Millstone each year. It passed in 2017 and was enacted in 2019, and will continue through 2029. (You can see the vote totals for the Senate here [https://cga.ct.gov/2017/VOTE/s/2017SV-00465-R00SB01501-SV.htm](https://cga.ct.gov/2017/VOTE/s/2017SV-00465-R00SB01501-SV.htm) and the House here [https://cga.ct.gov/2017/VOTE/h/2017HV-00416-R00SB01501-HV.htm](https://cga.ct.gov/2017/VOTE/h/2017HV-00416-R00SB01501-HV.htm) ) Here's a story from 2017 from the Mirror: [https://ctmirror.org/2017/10/26/millstone-bill-passes-house-goes-to-governor/](https://ctmirror.org/2017/10/26/millstone-bill-passes-house-goes-to-governor/) - """"A majority of Democrats opposed the bill; A majority of Republicans supported it.""""

Fast forward to this year, and the utilities are pointing fingers at the legislature. This piece from CT Mirror lays out the hard numbers - [https://www.wshu.org/connecticut-news/2024-02-16/eversource-utilities-rate-hike-pura](https://www.wshu.org/connecticut-news/2024-02-16/eversource-utilities-rate-hike-pura) - """"Eversource said the Millstone credit authorized by the General Assembly in 2017 caused $605 million of the $784 million in unrecovered costs; another $160 million is blamed on mandated benefits for the poor and medical hardship cases.""""

$605 million out of $784 million is 77.168%, and when two members of PURA's leadership board outvoted PURA's commissioner earlier this year to approve the increase at hand - she tried to get the increases spread out over a longer period of time to prevent sticker shock - we end up where we are now.

As stated above, we use a lot of natural gas here, and in the last five years, the Millstone agreement has kept the nuclear plant open and active, preserving a few thousand jobs on the coast and supporting clean energy generation. It's been beneficial in a few limited time periods when nat gas spiked in cost, as we've got issues with transmission from Europe and other parts of the country that cause cost constraints, but generally, it's costing, on average, $120 million a year.

So why are the Powers That Be downplaying the $120m per year total while blaming everything on the $160m of costs accrued over four years, the argument that's been getting to the news and is all over social media? Well, I can personally confirm Eversource has been building a PR army, given they hired Governor Lamont's former communications director (and they tried to hire me, personally, from my current job where I've learned enough about CT energy policy to write this post). They don't like PURA's chair, who is more seriously regulating them for the first time since state deregulation, and they want to get her fired - and they're willing to pressure the people of Connecticut to get that.

The CT GOP has helped them out the whole way. We've got Republicans in leadership positions on the Energy & Technology Committee (Rep. Buckbee) voting against tougher regulations against Eversource and UI. The state Republicans think this is an issue they can blame on poor people and get people frothing at the mouth over Democrats giving handouts (with the alternative being tens of thousands of households losing power at the height of the pandemic). If you pay attention, you'll learn that simply voting for the other party isn't going to help - in fact, it'll give them the same power they used to get the Millstone agreement passed.

Eversource and the CT GOP want you to blame this on Democrats because Democrats are in power in Hartford. They can only do this if you don't know the CT GOP played a leading role in 77% of your bill going up due to a bill they passed seven years ago. Don't let them get away with it. This is bigger than party - it's about the whole process.",1722627397,619,https://www.reddit.com/r/Connecticut/comments/1eij2xd/the_millstone_agreement_is_responsible_for_77_of/,187,Ftheyankeei,,,Health,186,444

Connecticut,1g45155,God I wish I had normal republicans to vote for,"I live in the first district, and it’s been an amazingly frustrating election to me. On one hand we have Larson, a man who’s been in office FAR too long and seems pretty cozy to me. I hardly ever hear of him pursuing some new goal or mission or policy, and instead he seems to just be an old man comfortably laying back in his horrendously gerrymandered district. But on the other hand we have Jim Griffin, a complete nut case, conspiracy theorist who committed assault on numerous occasions. 

Like, JESUS. I just want a normal opposition. I hate Leora Levy, Jim Griffin, and Matthew Corey. I hate stupid conspiracy theories, ridiculous MAGA nutcases, and extremist ideology. All I want is a normal center-right politician who I can vote for when I get tired of the center-left one.

Even if you’re liberal or left-wing, doesn’t that sound nice? I want to have an actual OPTION to keep my politicians accountable. When I get sick of one, I want to be able to have a credible opposition who isn’t a lunatic. This isn’t healthy for a democracy. To keep politicians accountable they have to be able to lose, and yet the main opposition party nominated people I could never vote for! It’s so damn FRUSTRATING! The CT-GOP has completely neglected its duty to be a credible main party, in favor of being a niche special interests party to the states small, socially-conservative, MAGA minority. And EVERYONE suffers as a result. 

MAGA voters don’t get what they want, since their candidates will never win.

Center-right voters don’t get what they want, since Trumpism and right wing extremism poisons the well for normal moderate republicans, making it 10000x harder for them to be elected.

The rest of the state loses out too, because in a system like this when one party can always expect to win, there’s nothing keeping them accountable! This is exactly why Bridgeport politics seem so corrupt; because the Bridgeport republicans are so extreme and unlikable that the democrats know they’ll win even if they literally break laws.

Connecticut,19esjeu,Yall have no idea how good you have it,"I lived in Connecticut for pretty much my entire life, until I moved to rural Michigan, about 10 minutes from Toledo, Ohio, 2 years ago. I didn't want to leave, I really didn't, but unfortunately my financial situation made it impossible to stay in CT, so we moved to Michigan because it's cheaper and we were closer to family.

It. Fucking. Sucks. I really never appreciated Connecticut until I was forced to live somewhere much worse. Where I'm from in Fairfield County, Bridgeport is seen as the hood, a place to be avoided.

Toledo has a crime rate 3 times that of Bridgeport, Bridgeport's is actually not that different from the national average.

In Connecticut, I was walking distance from at least 5 restaurants I would rate 5 stars. The nicest restaurant here is Subway. 

In terms of things to do for fun, you can go bowling or drink I guess, if that's your thing. Meth is a pretty popular activity around here.

The local high school's primary doner is a former school board member who owns a gun store and had to resign in disgrace after making extremely racist comments towards President Obama on Facebook.

The homophobia and general shittiness I experience in Michigan was unimaginable in Connecticut.

Whenever I come back to CT and visit my old pals and my favorite places around town, I tear up seeing everything I left behind.

Count your blessings, Connecticut is better than 90% of the country.",1706133429,625,https://www.reddit.com/r/Connecticut/comments/19esjeu/yall_have_no_idea_how_good_you_have_it/,219,ElectivireMax,,,Defense and National Security,186,444
Connecticut,1elssdx,Trans People Belong in Connecticut!,"Hi all, I’m a trans woman and community organizer, and I’ve lived here in Connecticut my whole life. I’m just as fed up with the cost of living and traffic as everyone else but can I just say what a blessing it is to live in this state? I love my local community, I love the bustling cities, and I love the beautiful foliage and landscape that surrounds us. 

I especially appreciate how I’m able to access my life saving medical care here, as many of my trans friends I’ve made during my journey have actually fled from other states due to no longer being able to recieve healthcare or being in fear for their life.

In spite of the unique set of challenges that we as trans people and transfeminine people in particular face, Since beginning my transition here in this state I have quite literally never been happier or felt more alive and like myself. The laws in place to help support us trans people and the more accepting nature of some of my peers are things that I will forever be grateful for, and I’m well aware that that’s not the case in many other states. 

Even though I’ve faced plenty of workplace discrimination, housing discrimination, seemingly neverending misogyny, lost many friends and family, and even experienced discrimination from law enforcement, I’ve managed to carve out a place for myself in my home state, and I want every other trans person reading this to know they can too 💞 we belong here. Don’t let anyone convince you otherwise. 

edit: wow!! thank you so much everyone for the outpouring of support. Your words of encouragement matter deeply to every trans person who comes accross this thread, I really appreciate it. We’ve had a couple transphobes and people trying to spread hate discover this post, but theyve been rightfully downvoted and ignored!!

Delaware,1d1jrqi,Delaware College of Art & Design closed without warning. First-Year DCAD College Students in Need!! Anything will help.,"[***DCAD Permanently Closed without a single word and nobody is talking about it.***](https://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/education/2024/05/23/delaware-college-of-art-and-design-announces-permanent-closure-wilmington/73821899007/)

[https://technical.ly/workforce-development/dcad-closure-student-impact-community-support/](https://technical.ly/workforce-development/dcad-closure-student-impact-community-support/)

**Hi, my name is Juli. I am 19 years old and I was a First-Year Animation Student at DCAD** (Delaware College of Art & Design, located in Wilmington, Delaware). This will be a bit lengthy but please take some time out of your day to read this all the way through, this is a serious matter and literally anything you can offer will be helpful: Whether it's reading this all the way through, an upvote, spreading the word to your family and friends, a word of wisdom, any thoughts, suggestions, advice, information, or even money- literally ANYTHING will be appreciated. So please bare with me and try to make it through this message. **If you truly need to skim through it though, you can read through the bold parts to get the quick idea of what happened, since I know some people are busy.**

**Going to DCAD was easily one of the best experiences of my life.** I have dreamed of being an animator and professional artist for years and I had seen so much growth from literally only 1 year of going to DCAD. Art means everything to me and being able to improve the way I am able to express myself through it was one of the biggest improvements I had ever been thankful for. My experiences were awesome, I made literally the best friends and often spent most of my days in the dorms because I had friends there **(I commuted)**. **The professors I had were amazing and during the final week of college, my professors were so excited for us to make art over the Summer. They even encouraged us to show them what we made when we came back for Fall 2024 or to even email them over the Summer if we needed anything. We finished the year saying """"see you next semester"""" and that was it. Because we believed that's what would happen.**

**Summer Vacation started and about 3 weeks passed**- by then, all of us were laying back and relaxing. **Nobody told ANY of us a single thing. Then the 23rd happened and we all received this in our emails OUT OF NOWHERE (Refer to the image attached).** I genuinely woke up, saw that in my inbox and thought I was dreaming. I looked in the group chat I had with some of my friends from the college and they were all in shock too. **They told us NOTHING about the college shutting down until 3 weeks after the Spring semester ended. They IN NO WAY prepared us for this information beforehand. Not only that, but their faculty also had absolutely no say in the college shutting down.** Both the college students AND the faculty were left entirely in the dark about this decision being made. NOT ONLY THAT- BUT ALL OF THIS HAPPENED DURING MEMORIAL WEEK. Which meant most of the offices being closed. I am not able to do anything until Tuesday in terms of calling up colleges for questions and appointments until Tuesday.

**All of this to say, the First-Years are left with the struggle of making the decision of what college to go to now. We could use literally any help at all**, whether its a word of advice, artists talking about their experiences at other colleges, DCAD Alumni, any college advisors willing to share information about how to get through this last minute decision, spreading the word, donations, literally anything. As I stated before, I commuted to college because obviously residency is super expensive. Now, because DCAD was the only place I could receive my Animation degree while commuting, **I need to move into a residency of another college which is a very massive change for me and my family. This isn't only me- this is a bunch of other students. So please, if you could offer any guidance or advice- or if you know anyone who can offer guidance or advice, we would sincerely appreciate it.**

**If by chance you want to donate or commission any of these college students who are currently struggling, please go to Instagram and look up JuliBirb and check her story highlight labeled """"College Help!"""". She has featured a few of the artists that she went to college with who are open to receiving donations/accepting commissions** (she is still trying to reach out to more of them)!

**If you want to help more but would prefer to not give money (which is 100% okay, as college students, we more than understand!), you can look at the pinned reel on JuliBirb's profile for more information about this and interact with that reel to spread the word! You can copy the link, post it on your story, like it, comment, save it, anything at all that might help spread the word- even making your own video about it if it will help!!**

☀️💛

**Thank you so much for reading this far, we really appreciate it.** **You reading alone helps SO much because it means the word was spread to one more person. Please keep in mind:** ***anything helps.***",1716785602,173,https://www.reddit.com/r/Delaware/comments/1d1jrqi/delaware_college_of_art_design_closed_without/,171,xJujuBeanx,,,Crime and Law Enforcement,59,153.3

This is a person who is incompetent and poorly informed at best; more likely dishonest and not trustworthy. 

I had actually talked to Dr. Katz at some length in person in June and thought he sounded very reasonable if a little vague. I've voted for third party candidates on a number of occasions. After this AMA, I've done a complete 180. It's clear to me that this Dr. Mike Katz is a dangerous choice and I would never vote for him.

Newark, DE  19702 United States )


I am absolutely a wreck but I’m hoping someone can help me with figuring out my next move. 

On August 16 I dropped my healthy dog off for a 3 week board and train to get some help with his anxiety and aggression. The trainer was sending us videos and giving us updates and everything seemed fine. Fast forward to August 21 I received a call from my local pet hospital that my dog was dropped off dead. The facility never reached out to tell us that anything was even wrong. They also left us with the hospital bill. The hospital had to advocate for us to get them to pay the bill. They refuse to refund us our money or even tell us what happened. We were able to speak to someone ONCE and his answer was “stuff like this happens”. I am in shambles over this and don’t know what to do from here. My fear is this happening to another dog. 

Can I sue? How do I report them? Does anyone know a lawyer or the process for this? ",1724371299,696,https://www.reddit.com/r/Delaware/comments/1eyyl95/i_dropped_off_my_dog_at_a_board_and_train/,355,Competitive_Book8831,,,Health,59,153.3

No, you *do not* have 6 weeks to decide. If you are able to find out the day of your missed period, you are [already considered 4 weeks pregnant](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0300-0399/0390/Sections/0390.011.html). However, it can take [7 days or more after a missed period to get a positive pregnancy test](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/11585-conception). This assumes someone has a 100% predictable cycle, which is not the reality for many people.

You can vote to repeal the ban by voting YES on [Amendment 4](https://ballotpedia.org/Florida_Amendment_4,_Right_to_Abortion_Initiative_(2024)) on November 5th (or in late October with [early voting](https://dos.fl.gov/elections/for-voters/voting/early-voting-and-secure-ballot-intake-stations/)).

Florida,1fwvcdy,Anyone other FL natives think this state has become unlivable in the last 5 years?,"I’ve been breaking the news to my family and friends that I’ve decided to leave Florida. I expected people to ask why, but the other native Floridians have *almost* universally agreed with my reasoning and said they also want to leave. The reasons are usually something like:

- Heat/humidity is unrelenting.
- Hurricanes. I used to not care about them until I became a homeowner. I can deal with *some* hurricanes, but it seems like we’re a very likely target for just about every storm that happens. 
- Car and home insurance. Need I say more. 
- Cost of living/home prices. The only people who can afford a decent life are the legions of recent arrivals who work remote jobs with higher salaries in NYC (or wherever)
- It’s seriously so fucking hot. Jesus Christ how am I sweating while getting the mail in October? The heat makes going outside to do fun stuff a no-go for ~7 months of the year

Anyway, I was wondering if this is a widespread sentiment? The recent transplants I’ve spoken to seem more resolute on staying here. ",1728148555,7179,https://www.reddit.com/r/florida/comments/1fwvcdy/anyone_other_fl_natives_think_this_state_has/,2481,real_strikingearth,,,Health,356,2060.9

Georgia,1d0xky7,PSA to Georgia Amazon Prime Members,"Today I noticed that my Amazon Prime Membership renewed on my credit card statement. To my surprise, I noticed that I was overcharged. A membership should cost $139/year but I was charged $147.37.

I already knew about Senate Bill 56, which was signed May 2023 that would tax digital products and became effective the first of this year. But the law only applies to permanent goods and excludes any services that require recurring payment (subscriptions).

When I contacted support they told me the additional charge was for tax and offered me a $10 refund immediately, even before I mentioned that collecting tax on a digital subscription is unlawful.

It looks like they are charging all Georgia Prime Members this tax, not just me, and I am here to tell you that what they are doing is stealing. Even if unintentional, it's grossly negligent for a company of this size.

This goes for more than just Amazon. For instance, if you get charged a tax for buying a digital game on Xbox Live, that's okay. However, if you get charged a tax for buying an Xbox Live subscription, that is not okay. And the same goes for Amazon, don't let them steal your money.

Here are some links that explain Senate Bill 56 and what can and cannot be charged as a tax on digital goods.

Georgia,1fv8gcn,"The Biolab Fire is Dangerous, Heed Caution. ","*UPDATE* Phosgene gas has been reported to be a chemical in the plume by Rockdale Government. Research what phosgene gas does. 

-----
Today marks day five since the Biolab fire. The word is to turn off your AC, and reduce time outside.

The product being off gassed is called """"pool shock"""", which produces chlorine gas. Chlorine gas was banned from warfare after WW1. 
That's just one chemical. The whole plant burned down. We do not know what other chemicals are in there. 

To reiterate, the whole plant burned down. There are people who say that this has happened before, possibly to offer up reassurance. 
While hope is generally good, it is import to note that there has never been a fire at this scale at this plant in history. 

If you want to see the results of a chemical fallout, look up East Palestine, Ohio. The train derailment of 2023 offers a lot of insight into what the future of this could be. 

If you have asthma or any breathing condition, please take this seriously. 

If you are concerned about breathing in bleach for days on end, please take this seriously. 

At this point, it is everywhere in at least a 50 mile radius of Rockdale. Even if you can't see it, it's in the air. 

I am saying this because I love my community in Georgia, and the ones who should be telling us this are giving us copium. 

I am afraid, and I think that is appropriate given the situation. 

If you cannot get out, please consider running an air purifier.

EDIT: I am not saying turn off your AC. I am saying that this is the advice the officials have given, as an example of the poor messaging. 

Another edit to be crystal clear: Running AC or not, this is dangerous. The best way to avoid the cloud is to get away from it. 

EDIT**: Rockdale Government has issued a statement. Please read what the chemicals in the smoke are, and please look up what each one of them is and does https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=955228049978973&id=100064753594456

Georgia,1fjvz3e,A Georga doctor almost refused to do a D&C on my sister after a miscarriage.,"First off some background.

My sister is a southern bell who goes to the church of christ. She takes her religion very seriously and my sister has even said she'd rather die and her baby be born then she live and the baby die. My sister is the last person who would ever want to get an abortion.

However shortly after the abortion ban my sister had a miscarriage. A regular, miscarriage. Something that is routine.

Her doctor was uncomfortable at first performing a D&C cause he wasn't sure if that would count as an abortion and potential put him in legal liability.

My family was prepared to fly my sister to another state.

The doctor then decided he'd do the D&C and my sister was fine.

The thing is...those abortion bans do more then just stop abortions. They muddy the waters for medical professionals. I don't want my doctor weighing legal liability vs doing what's right for the patient.

We need to leave medical decisions up to medical professionals.

Fyi this experience had a profound affect on both my sister and brother in law. As they were both pro life. However they now see the complications that come with abortion ban. They would never ever opt for an abortion...yet the abortion ban almost killed my sister.",1726674183,6994,https://www.reddit.com/r/Georgia/comments/1fjvz3e/a_georga_doctor_almost_refused_to_do_a_dc_on_my/,628,ZacZupAttack,,,Health,245.3,910.6

Hawaii,186twf4,Racism from the asian community against blacks. -Discussion,"As a Black man living in Oahu for the last eight years, I've encountered a form of racism that feels very different from what I was accustomed to on the mainland. 

This experience has been challenging for me, especially considering the prevalent """"Stop Asian Hate"""" movement. Despite being a middle-class individual who takes great care in my appearance (neat haircuts, no beard, just a small mustache, and always wearing clean, pressed polos and khakis or slacks), I am still treated with a level of disdain that I find deeply unsettling.In public spaces like elevators, I've noticed both Asian men and women visibly avoiding me, sometimes even making desperate attempts to close the doors before I can enter. Walking on sidewalks, I've observed men guiding their families away from me, sometimes even crossing the street to avoid passing by me. This behavior extends to parking lots too, where the sound of car locks beeping repeatedly becomes evident as I walk by, despite just being a customer like everyone else.

Dining out presents its own challenges. In restaurants, I often feel ignored and have to make an effort to be seen and heard. Even when acknowledged, there's a palpable sense of unwantedness. My experiences at Vons Chicken particularly stand out. Initially, the female staff there were friendly and knew me by name. However, once a man started working there, his derogatory comments in Korean (which I couldn't understand but were clearly offensive) changed the atmosphere completely. The women would react to his comments, giving me sympathetic looks, before ushering him away.

My cousin, living in a fancy high-rise in ward among many upper-middle-class Asians, faces similar issues. Her use of building amenities like the pool is often met with residents hastily leaving the area. She's also experienced aggressive behavior like doors being shut in her face and an incident where an elevator door was deliberately closed on her, briefly trapping her.These experiences have left me questioning the stance of the Asian community, particularly the younger generation, on this kind of racism. Are they actively working against it, or is there a tendency to silently comply?

 I’m reaching out to other Black individuals and people of color to hear about their experiences in similar situations. I also want to ask Asian people, especially the younger ones, about their actions or inactions against such blatant racism. What steps can we collectively take to combat and dispel this kind of discrimination? I'm tired of living this way and am seeking a path towards change.

Edit: People seem to think I'm referring to local/ Polynesian population. Let me be clear. I am not. I'm referring to the Asians who were born over seas and came as adults. The Crispy white Porsche, high end fashion, designer bags, Ward village, Kahala type of Asians. Some of you understood this and some don't. As far as ACTUAL locals born and raised here I have no issue with them. They are very friendly to me and I call many friends. And even as strangers I have great interactions with them.

This foolish individual had his say in a story critical of Puna's first responders published on the San Francisco Gate website, so now it’s my turn to respond: 

For ten years I lived in an oceanfront house seen in the close distance in the SFGate photo. This is Paradise Ala Kai Drive. This isolated location is 7 miles from the nearest store or services of any kind. It is pitch black at night with deadly voids in the disintegrating cliffs and tripping hazards literally everywhere. NEVER in 10 years did I venture out at night anywhere near the edge of these cliffs, nor even would my dogs do so, for only a stumbling drunk, someone high on drugs, or a complete idiot would risk it. What these people were up to under such deadly circumstances in this area AT NIGHT is beyond comprehension, but I can tell you it was no good. That they expected our brave firemen to scale down a crumbling slippery 25-foot cliff where at the bottom 10-foot waves await to dash them against razor sharp boulders before venturing into a den of sharks is absolutely maddening. The “31 year old boyfriend” is totally responsible for himself and for what happened to his companion. How dare he denigrate Hawaii’s brave first responders. Apparently he himself didn’t enter the water in any attempt to rescue her but fully expects others to put their lives on the line for these two arrogant entitled careless individuals. In the years I lived right at this very spot, many a tourist, local opihi picker, limu harvester, lobster diver and fisherman have died with first responders placing their own lives on the line every time to try and save such fool adventurists.

The “31 year old man” spouting uncalled for and unmerited critical utterances should be held responsible for his companion’s sorry end. https://www.sfgate.com/hawaii/article/hawaii-drowning-victim-boyfriend-responders-18682495.php

Hawaii,1dd2f6h,I regret moving to California. The Aloha is not there. The people seem distant and too much on guard.,"During COVID, I had a big mental breakdown and decided to pack my things and move the mainland. I lost my job, my friends, and broke ties with everyone because I went through a dark spiral of depression and projected my anxiety to anyone within my reach.

Now I'm in California. I feel even more depressed. I have no friends. Even if I do make some, it doesn't feel like an authentic connection; I just don't vibe like I do with my homeboys in Hawaii. Somewhere deep down, I intuitively sense that I'm being patronized because I'm not """"proper"""" or it's because I have an island accent. I feel like people look down on me and treat me like less than their equal. Being Asian doesn't help as well.

Looking at rooms for a place to stay and I noticed there's a 70-80% increase in rental price. A 1 bedroom that cost $1400, is now $2300-500? I screwed myself coming to the mainland trying to get an accounting job. I made more as a server/bartender in Hawaii lol.

Hawaii,1ep4gwy,Nasty behavior from new arrivals,"Hi all, just needed space to rant. Born and raised on Oahu, live on the continent now and occasionally visit home to see family. I sometimes feel like I don’t recognize home anymore. Everything looks different, but I also feel like there’s been a vibe shift.. like people are just nastier and more self-focused overall. Not saying this is coming solely from transplants but I feel like that has a lot to do with it. There are so many more new people here post-Covid. 

I was at the grocery store the other day and this lady who was clearly a transplant was blocking the aisle with her cart while she was stooped over sticking out her big behind looking at something on the shelf. I said “excuse me” in a polite way (not rude or snarky) and walked in front of her bc there was literally no other way to get past. I didn’t have a cart or anything, simply walked in front of her. She went crazy and called me a “stupid fucking bitch” and yelled that I could have walked behind her (there was literally no room). I was like wtf? She was SO angry for no reason. I told her that this wasn’t the continent and she shouldn’t talk like that here and she was like “I’ve been here longer than you!” 🙄🤮I’m not a confrontational person so I just walked away but the interaction threw me off so much.

Then a couple days later at Costco I saw an old guy who was also clearly not local yell at a kid for bumping into his cart. He called him a jackass and was raising his voice and demanding an apology.

Lastly, I ordered a box from Farmlink and went to get it at the pickup spot. I was in line waiting for the worker when this lady comes and cuts in front of me and asks about her box, then walks over to the employee-only area, opens the fridge and moves around all the boxes looking for hers, grabs it, and walks away. The worker and I just exchange looks like wth was that. A couple minutes later she’s near me while I’m moving stuff from the box to my bag (so they can reuse the box) and I notice she has a tote bag from a store in SF. I ask if she’s from SF and she smiles and says yes and asks if I am too. I said no and she says that she just moved here. I wanted to be like “I can tell” but didn’t say anything. 

Anyway, I just feel like… grossed out by all these interactions and low key am wondering what Hawaii will look like in another 20 years. It just feels like these people don’t get it and I hate the thought of more of them moving here. I’ve also noticed that when I’m on a plane with mostly non-local people that everyone is in a free for all to get off the plane first. Does anyone else notice that? Just total cultural differences… they’re so entitled and have no sense of community. Not saying ALL new residents are like that, but a lot certainly seem to be, enough that it’s noticeable. Also, I’m not racist and am not anti-haole, but for context, yes they were all white. 

Edit: I’m not saying locals are incapable of this sort of behavior and that every single new resident is like this. My point is that this behavior unfortunately isn’t uncommon and it coincides with our home undergoing many changes to the culture and lifestyle. Some of it is just the times. But it’s also true that many local families are struggling and more locals are moving away, while more people from elsewhere are coming in. If you’re triggered by me saying this you’re probably part of the problem.

Hawaii,1fnszdv,Jerk in front of Honolulu Planned Parenthood,"This morning I was headed to Planned Parenthood when I approached the only entrance, a man with obnoxious pro-life signs was blasting music (maybe some sort of prayer or gospel but I tried to get past him as fast as possible). He was standing on the sidewalk directly in front of the entrance so I had maybe two feet of clearance to get past him. He shouted “abortion is murder” as I walked by. Regardless of your opinion on the issue, planned parenthood provides so many services beyond abortions and it’s a saddening that people should feel shamed or scared to use their services. I for one have been going to planned parenthood for years for checkups, immunizations, etc and used to feel comfortable doing so. I was under the impression that it was illegal to protest directly at the entrance after hearing horror stories of my mothers from back in the day, when she ironically, was trying to get prenatal care. It’s not my first time seeing protesters at a planned parenthood but they were always a certain distance from the entrance, is there a reason he’s allowed to berate people like this?

Hawaii,1dwawd9,The biggest culture shock I got from moving to the mainland for me was...,"
... this heightened sense of individualism to the point where it's almost selfishness. Back home, there's a strong sense of community and interconnectedness. People genuinely look out for each other, and there's an unspoken understanding that helping a friend out is just what you do without expecting anything in return, but often times people do pay you back by like treating you out or offering to help you for a favor next, mainly because you didn't expect anything back in the first place.

On the mainland, it feels like the prevailing mindset is """"what's in it for me?"""" rather than """"how can I help?"""" People are more focused on hyperindividualism and less on building and maintaining community. Like I get if in one instance you don't have the time or capacity to help someone out, but if like you're perfectly capable and won't negatively affect you in any way, why not help out a friend? Back home it's normal if several friends and even acquaintances banded together to lend a hand, without expecting anything in return. On the mainland, it often feels like favors come with strings attached or a sense of obligation, like you can't ask for help without offering a reward at first. Adjusting to this change has been one of the biggest challenges of moving away from the islands.

My wife and I met in Idaho but she is from Montana and I went to the University of Montana so we knew we wanted to move here when we knew we would be together long term. 

My wife and I were expecting our second baby when she started bleeding and cramping this week. This progressed through the week until today when her bleeding became uncontrollable. I took her to the ER and she just made it through a successful D&C. 

If we’d been in Idaho there’s a chance my wife may have died because of this miscarriage. We have a toddler already, my wife is my everything and the thought of losing her, and my child losing her mother, because there are people out there who are either are so dissatisfied with their own lives that they feel the need to control others or have been manipulated into thinking abortion is somehow a religious issue is just too much. 

Hopefully it won’t be like this for Idahoans, and many others, forever. ",1730589901,673,https://www.reddit.com/r/Idaho/comments/1gi9e6r/so_grateful_i_left_idaho/,184,Impossible_Cycle9460,,,Education and Social Services,175.6,316.3

Idaho,1fwzs6f,Idaho State Senator tells Native American Candidate ‘go back where you came from’,"Idaho state senator tells Native American candidate ‘go back where you came from’ in forum

Tensions rose during a bipartisan forum this week after an audience question about discrimination reportedly led an Idaho state senator to angrily tell a Native American candidate to “go back where you came from.”

Republican Sen. Dan Foreman left the event early after the outburst and later denied making any racist comments in a Facebook post. 

Trish Carter-Goodheart, a Democratic candidate for the House District 6 seat and member of the Nez Perce Tribe, said the blowup left her shaken and thinking about security needs for future public events. 

“Having conversations about racism with an 8-year-old and a 5-year-old is not something me and my husband Dane were prepared for,” Carter-Goodheart said Friday. “They’ve never seen a grown adult man have a meltdown like that. They were scared. I was scared.”

The event was held by Democratic and Republican precinct committee members from the small north-Idaho town of Kendrick on Monday night. It was for House and Senate candidates from the local district, including Foreman; his Democratic opponent, Julia Parker: Republican Rep. Lori McCann; and her Democratic opponent, Carter-Goodheart.

About an hour into the event, someone asked a question about a state bill addressing discrimination. The candidates were each given two minutes to answer, and when it was Carter-Goodheart’s turn, she pushed back on earlier comments that suggested discrimination is not a major issue in Idaho.

She said state hate crime laws are weak, and noted that the neo-nazi group Aryan Nations made northern Idaho its home base for many years. She also talked about being the only candidate there who was a person of color.

“I pointed out that just because someone hasn’t personally experienced discrimination doesn’t mean it’s not happening,” she said. “I was making my statement, and then he shot up out of his seat and said, ‘I’m so sick of your liberal (expletive). Why don’t you go back to where you came from?’”

The Nez Perce Tribe has lived on the Columbia River Plateau in the Pacific Northwest for more than 11,500 years, including the area where Kendrick is located. The northern edge of its reservation, while only a small fraction of the tribe’s historical territory, is less than 10 miles (16 kilometers) from the Veterans of Foreign Wars hall where the forum was held.

In his Facebook post, Foreman called the incident a “quintessential display of race-baiting” and said the Democratic attendees made personal attacks and “proclaimed Idaho to be a racist state.”

“Well, here is a news flash for the lefties out there. There is no systemic racism in America or Idaho,” Foreman said. “Idaho is a great state — the best in the Union!”",1728160731,992,https://i.redd.it/z5i1av8410td1.jpeg,315,Sterling-Hospedales,https://storage.googleapis.com/policy_posse_reddit_images/reddit_post_images/1fwzs6f.jpg,https://storage.googleapis.com/policy_posse_reddit_images/reddit_post_images/1fwzs6f.jpg,Health,175.6,316.3

Idaho,1e502xv,Your Democrat vote isn't wasted in Idaho,"In 2020 1,082,417 Idahoans were registered to vote. 554,119 of them voted for Trump.

Sure ~17k that are within that 49% voted 3rd party, but 79k people became eligible to vote between '20 and '22 (my guess would be even more between '22 and '24)The margins are thinner than Republicans would have you believe.

The state isn't owned by Republicans, your vote could make them think twice about calling Idaho a forgone conclusion. Your vote could almost certainly flip legislative seats at midterm and local elections. 

Democracy only works for those who participate. Register to vote, rally your friends, carpool with folks who may not be able to get to the polls on their own, do whatever you can to help every American voice be heard. Most importantly, people who tell you that your vote doesn't matter are un-American, un-patriotic, and altogether dishonest and pitiful.

And now they are the only state which does not track or review maternal deaths.

They did this right after banning all abortions.

And they have tightened requirements to qualify for Medicaid, causing many people to lose it. In 2018, 60.6% of Idaho voters voted to expand Medicaid coverage to adults whose income is too low for private health insurance.  But, in many cases, what citizens vote for doesn’t matter.

On Jan 9, 2024. The Idaho Statesman reported that the governor signed Legislation which would require many Medicaid beneficiaries to be employed in order to receive it. A waiver is pending.

Idaho legislators cut $38,000,000. from their state budget which had been earmarked for childcare.

The average SNAP beneficiary there recently lost $82. per month in benefits

Many OB/GYNs have already fled the state.

It’s now very dangerous to be a poor fertile woman, or the child of one, in Idaho.

Idaho,1fxso5u,What is going to happen when there are no teachers left because none of us can afford to remain in the profession?,"I teach in Idaho and have been scraping by for ten years. Recently I busted my ass and finished a masters degree and got a little bit of a pay bump. Unfortunately the cost of living has increased much more rapidly than the teacher pay in Idaho and even with my increased pay from my experience and a Masters degree I only make about half of what it costs to simply survive here. I'd love to teach forever but I literally can not afford to. What is even crazier is that I make about 25k more a year than the newer teachers. I've had several first year teachers come to me and ask about pay now that they have received their first checks and the reality of how little they make has set in. Some of the first and second year teachers have as much as 80% and 90% of their monthly pay going to housing alone. So I'm curious what you guys think will happen once all the teachers stop teaching because they quite literally can't afford to teach. I'm already seeing a lot more Teach for America teachers (a program that lets college grads from out of state come teach in Idaho for two years to have some of their students loans forgiven) and I'm seeing many more unqualified teachers than ever before. I'm talking very unqualified, like French teachers who don't speak French and health teachers who haven't finished an associates degree.

Idaho,190i04i,It’s January 6. Do you know where you local Idaho insurrections are?,"Never forget their names or family names.  They should be held accountable for their seditionist acts and violence against our great nation.   Remember them if you are hiring people for work or if you should happen to work for them:

Josiah Colt of Meridian.  Guilty of felony obstruction of official proceedings.  Serving 15 months in prison and 36 months of supervised release.  He stormed the Capitol with a Glock, zip ties, and gas mask.

Duke Wilson of Nampa.  Guilty of felony assault of an officer and serving 4 years for hitting a police officer with a OVC pipe.  Prosecutors warn that Wilson would knowingly do the same act if he heard the calling.

Yvonne St. Cyr of Boise.  She was charged with knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority and violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, both misdemeanors. St Cyr had been arrested in Boise the month before the coup for refusing to leave the Central District Health building during a protest about coronavirus precautions. 
St Cyr was arrested on the federal charges in February 2021. She pleaded not guilty to both charges on June 16, 2022. She went to trial in March 2023; the jury found her guilty on all counts and sentenced to 30 months in prison and three years supervised release.

Michael Pope of Sandpoint.  Charged with felony obstructing or impeding official proceedings and civil disorder as well as misdemeanor counts of entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds; disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds, disorderly conduct in a Capitol building, impeding passage through the Capitol grounds or buildings, and parading, demonstrating or picketing in a Capitol building. 

Pam Hempill of Boise.  Guilty of 4 misdemeanors: entering and remaining in a restricted building, disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building, violent entry and disorderly conduct in a Capitol building and parading, demonstrating, or picketing in a Capitol building.  Served 2 months.  Also is a Bundy compatriot.


Tyler Tew of Idaho Falls.  Guilty of 4 counts of entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds, disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds, disorderly conduct in a Capitol building, and parading, demonstrating, or picketing in a Capitol building. ",1704596710,603,https://www.reddit.com/r/Idaho/comments/190i04i/its_january_6_do_you_know_where_you_local_idaho/,540,f-around-findout,,,Crime and Law Enforcement,175.6,316.3

Idaho,1fj3kyx,Never or rarely vote? This year's the time.,"
Idaho's politics are crazy and only a big upwelling of voters can change that. We have a chance to change the extremism by voting for the Open Primaries Initiative (Prop 1). Plus many of the state legislature positions are decided by just a few hundred votes. Consider voting Democrat this year, even if you are """"team R"""" because geez Louise check what your """"Rs"""" have been up to -- and intend to do. Like maybe you are pro-life, but do you want to keep those exceptions for rape and incest? Maybe you think it's a good idea to allow abortions in medical emergencies and not send miscarrying women to bleed in a parking lot until they are at death's door. Perhaps you think contraception is a good idea. Many of your Idaho """"Rs"""" are coming after these things. Check them. They need a time out. Put some more moderate folks in office, vote yes on prop 1, and bring sanity back to Idaho.

For a lot of us locals, it also means leaving behind friends and aging family members. Lost my grandpa last year. Parents are aging and my dad doesn't think he has much longer time left (health issues). 

So to all you bigoted conservatives that tell me to just leave like it's the easiest thing in the world you can eat me. If I wanted to I could be out of this country entirely in a month... but I'd have to take a really shitty job doing so (something I've seriously considered multiple times), but I just can't bring myself to do it. 

I want to leave on my own terms. But also, as much as I hate the ass-backwards politics I've realized I actually don't hate my life here. It often feels like I've dead-ended myself, but I can fix that by going back to school or getting some more certifications.

Also, keep in mind that while Cook County is the largest county in IL and Chicagoland, it’s NOT the only county in Chicagoland. Looking at current population estimates for Lake, Kane, DuPage, Will, and McHenry counties, there are approximately 3.2 million residents within those counties, if you want to limit Chicagoland to those counties.

My name is Jackie and I'm running for office as the first openly transgender person to ever run in my county! (And the second one to run in the state)

I'm also an engineer, DND nerd, avid biker, and have a [candidate page](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61556081158535) if you're interested in checking it out.

My views can vastly be described as """"pretty moderate."""" Although I'm running Democrat because those moderate views align mostly with viewing the govt as a service to the community and against the people who seem to want me dead and want to control every aspect of your life from your medical decisions to your religious practices.

While this position I wouldn't be making state wide decisions (like legalizing marijuana, implementing ranked choice voting, and banning corporations from owning residential property), it will be a stepping stone to prove myself worthy of eventually being able to help out this whole state.

This year I'm also trying to get a pride festival setup in our little town. Even if I lose I hope to have left a mark here.

Indiana,1cpi65f,Lets ruin Mike Brauns career and boost support for Jennifer McCormick,"No sane person wants Braun to lead the state of Indiana, he will govern for Maga extremists and leave the majority of us in the dirt. 

My first introduction to this dude was when he made headlines for rallying people on street corners in Washington DC on January 6th 2021, the second time I heard about about him was in 2022 when he made a comment about how he thinks that interracial marriage should be left up to the states...changing his tune when he received unwanted national attention, the third time I heard of him was this past year when he started popping up on my local news station in commercials touting himself as a """"Pro Trump Republican"""".

To be honest, the dude just makes me phucking sick, I belief we need to move on from anything Trump and allow this state and country to have some new blood. 

I personally vote for the person and Braun is not the person I believe that should be representing Hoosier men, women and children.  

ALL of us men need to be standing up for the women in our lives by standing against Braun, we need to be encouraging EVERYONE to vote against him by calling him out. 

Want to call Jennifer McCormick out? Good luck, the woman hasn't made enemies, she is an Republican turned Democrat, an educator, a woman that cares for her fellow women, the future of children and a person that truly cares about the Hoosier state, support her and BE LOUD ABOUT IT!'

We deserve a governor who cares about the health, safety and prosperity of ALL Hoosiers.

Indiana,1encgkd,Three Indiana Supreme Court Justices are on The Ballot This Year. All Three of Them Voted in Favor of A Total Abortion Ban.,"This year we have potential to make change, to say that we won't stand for the endangerment of Women's Lives and Rights.

On June 30th, 2023 the Indiana Supreme Court decided in a 4-1 decision that an Abortion Ban was constitutional, and allowed the law to continue. 

Three of those Justices, specifically Mark Massa, Derek Molter, and Lorette Rush are on the ballot this year. Although we may not be able to choose their replacements, we can prevent them from getting another 10 years in office. 

Abortion is healthcare. Strict Abortion laws help no one, and will only hurt women who need one.

We've seen this time and time again, such as the case of [Kristen Anaya](https://abcnews.go.com/US/woman-sepsis-life-saving-abortion-care-texas/story?id=99294313) who despite having lost her baby, was forced to continously get sicker until she went into sepsis until she would be allowed to get an abortion, or [Jaci Statton](https://www.businessinsider.com/oklahoma-woman-told-wait-in-parking-lot-until-crashing-abortion-2023-4?op=1) was told to wait in the parking lot until she was sick enough to be helped medically, and ended up driving to another state to get one. There are hundreds of examples like this. These are all women who wanted to be pregnant, who wanted to have babies and many of these women became infertile afterwards.

Banning Abortion does not protect life. It endangers it. We must tell our government that it is not okay to force women to suffer like this. We need to band together, and force everyone who allowed the abortion ban out of office. 

Not only are these 3 supreme court justices on the ballot, but so is the position of attourney general, governer, state senate and house, along with more local positions. 

Do not just vote for president this election, do not just vote federally. Vote all the way down the ballot. Turnout for elections (during presidental years) is only at 65%, don't let anyone convince you that indiana can't be better, that it can't be blue. Show up and Vote. 

Unfortunately, we can't directly choose their replacements. The governor will be responsible for that, so it's important to vote for a governor who cares about women's rights. The Democratic Nominee for Governor is Mccormick. Check her out! 

https://www.mccormickforgov.com/

All Justices appointed this term will be on the ballot again in 2 years. So make sure that whether we like them or not, we go out to vote, even if it's not a presidential year.

Vacancies. Section 19. [If 22 the Lieutenant Governor, while acting as Governor, shall be impeached, displaced, resign, or die, or otherwise become incapable of performing the duties of the office, the President pro tempore of the Senate shall act as Governor until the vacancy is filled, or the disability removed; and if the President of the Senate, for any of the above causes, shall be rendered incapable of performing the duties pertaining to the office of Governor, the same shall devolve upon the Speaker of the House of Representatives.]*

In 2008, Iowa voted blue for Obama. We can absolutely get there again!!

Two days ago I had a frank conversation with my late-80’s grandmother and asked her to reconsider voting for Donald Trump. I told her that I hope she’ll be here for a long time yet, but that I was scared that putting him in office will have ramifications that will last the rest of my lifetime. I told her that what he brings to the table were things I absolutely do not want.  I asked her to give real thought and consideration before she votes for Trump and the world she’ll be signing me up for by doing so. 

She told me that she couldn’t bring herself to vote for Harris, but that she would honor the future that I want to inherit and will not be casting a vote this year. Not for Trump. That means the world to me. 

If you have people that you love who will hold their nose and vote for Trump, talk to them. Tell them that you love them and you’re scared. Ask them to give thought to their vote before casting it. Every vote matters. ",1726659643,615,https://www.reddit.com/r/Iowa/comments/1fjqo6j/lets_make_iowa_swing_blue_this_year/,261,Glittering-Leg5527,,,Other / Uncategorized,235.3,548.6

Iowa,1gcnkac,Friendly reminder about Trump Tariffs…,"If you’re an Iowan, especially one in the agriculture industry, who is planning on voting for Trump in the next 10 days primarily for his economic agenda, I’m here to remind you that last time Trump was in office and he imposed blanket tariffs on Chinese goods, the ensuing trade war that any economist could have predicted cost Iowa farmers billions and many of you had to rely on government subsidies to get by.

This doesn’t even account for the fact that, despite what Trump keeps saying, tariffs ARE NOT paid by the country they are being imposed on, but by American importers that are reselling these goods or using these goods in their manufacturing processes. These tariffs are always accounted for in these businesses’ cost of goods and are always passed off to consumers in the form of inflated prices. Raised prices on imported goods will invariably mean raised prices on domestic goods. Inflation, inflation, inflation.

So farmers - while you’re hemorrhaging revenue from a bitter trade war because a large percentage of your corn and soybean sales are dependent on exporting to China, you’ll be hit by an unprecedented wave of inflation that you will feel and feel hard with every purchase you make.

Vote Trump at your own peril. I can promise you he doesn’t care about you, your families, your farms, or your livelihoods and in can promise you that if you help elect him, everything I just said will happen and Trump will not be there to save you.",1729956429,1911,https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/money/agriculture/2018/09/21/trump-china-trade-war-effects-iowa-agriculture-farming-exports-tariffs-canada-pork-soybeans-steel/1368546002/,452,bfitzyc,,,International Affairs and Trade,235.3,548.6

They're not. 

What's happening now will shape the lives of your children and their children, essentially forcing them into servitude and struggle for the rest of their lives. And statistically, some of you actually voted for it. 

It's all been about your kids. 

Who funnels state tax money to expensive private religious schools at the expense of public schools? 

**Someone who doesn't want poor kids to get an education. Who doesn't want to share resources with those they see as lesser.** 

Who turns away money for free school lunches?

**Someone who wants poor kids to be hungry, who wants their parents to have to spend what little money they have on food.** 

Who advocates for the mass deportation of migrants, especially knowing that without them, the entire agricultural industry will implode?

**Someone who has an idea of who can replace those workers, at the same low wage, for the same grueling conditions.** 

Who fights tooth and nail to stop abortion and birth control?

**Someone who knows that people have to make sacrifices when they have children, intentionally or not.** 

Who recklessly allows our water supply to be pumped full of chemicals, and advocates for the destruction of public health care?

**Someone who knows that sick people have fewer choices. They work or they die.** 

Who stands there under the eyes of the world and has the gall to suggest that child labor should be returned?

**Someone whose vision of the future depends on a workforce of young, uneducated, poor, unready parents who will take the jobs they are given and dare not ask for anything better.** 

This is the plan, and it has been for a long time. Your sons, uneducated, plagued by debt and obligations, taking their stations at the meat processing plant and standing there until sickness takes them, only to be replaced by their sons, and their sons. Your daughters caught in an endless cycle of motherhood, grand motherhood, etc. 

It won't effect their kids, of course. Their kids will get better educations, better choices. They'll drink bottled water and visit out-of-state doctors should something inconvenient occur, and some day they'll take over overseeing the endless parade of sick, impoverished and desperate proles we generate for them. 

And the best part is, they tricked you into thinking it was your idea. ",1725163105,923,https://www.reddit.com/r/Iowa/comments/1f65luo/this_is_the_plan_and_its_working/,293,TheBlackDogAffair,,,Health,235.3,548.6

Kansas,1df8qh6,"New porn law example ID, and how our state has failed us ","Just to make sure everyone knows what sort of IDs can be used to verify themselves when looking up porn. Maybe you have one of these IDs. Maybe the conservative government is giving you less freedoms so this ID “is an example ID only.”

It seems it’s the case that our conservative house and senate have enacted a law to unintentionally create a conduit of your private information across state lines and to other countries. This forceful law (copy-cat from other states) will harm minors and adults (who have access to drivers licenses, etc): with doxxing, location knowledge/ personal home address, and other private information that let criminals more easily gain access to your bank account, credit cards, your tax accounts / social security / social media / email and more. Porn sites, generally aren’t famous for their account security when you think about malware, etc. And our horrific government just entrusted them with all of this information. 

Kansas government has not created nor tested a system that is safe under these circumstances to keep all of your private info from getting out. 

The fact that the people who are elected to represent us now will make it easier for crime to find where you live: is appalling. 

Ex) if someone takes a pic of your license (remember: an example of one above) and uses it, or your rowdy teen grabs yours and uses it. 

Let’s let actual experts (not our government) figure out what is safe before passing half-assed laws that unnecessarily expose everything. 

Hey let’s keep the internet *anonymous* unless it’s to PROTECT your necessary information. 

Or you know, dissolve the legislature and elect all new people.

My masters project is centered around building a geology museum for our small department. My aim is to make the museum a modest celebration of our departments history while also highlighting the geology of neighboring states. I’ve created a display concept of “ won’t you be my neighbor” that aims to feature geology of Ohio’s neighboring states, as many students here get tunnel vision and forget that there is more cool geology just across our state boarders.. especially since kentucky is a 12 min drive across the river!  Problem is this project is entirely self funded, so I am looking for small fossil, mineral, and rock donations that you feel represent Kentucky.  Or if you have any advice on who to ask about kentucky specific rocks?

As an avid Reddit user I thought Reddit would be a good place to ask if anyone has any small rocks they’d be willing to donate to my masters project? Or if anyone has any good ideas of who to ask for / where to find small kentucky found pieces? 

Part of my aim is to make exhibits that encourage geology students and guests to explore and be curious about the things just past our doorstep, so any and all help in achieving this is greatly appreciated! Thank you in advance:)

When bitcoin was on a hot streak, owners of small industrial facilities in Kentucky struck up crypto mining partnerships with Chinese companies. Then things fell apart.

The firm shipped equipment from China to its hosting facility in Eastern Kentucky, then walked away with the bitcoin produced, leaving behind hundreds of thousands of dollars in unpaid energy bills and hosting fees.

Even if the Kentucky facility owners win out in court, it could be difficult to collect any damages awarded. “A judgment is essentially a piece of paper. Any judgment needs to be turned into assets or cash in order to be valuable,” says Havlin. If the opposing party refuses to pay up and has no US assets to collect against, sometimes that isn’t possible.",1729826385,235,https://www.wired.com/story/in-the-kentucky-mountains-a-bitcoin-mining-dream-becomes-the-stuff-of-nightmares/,51,SouthernSassenach97,,,Crime and Law Enforcement,47,124.3

(I live in Indiana now. Far from paradise, probably backwards compared to most of the country. And yet…)

Severe weather, power outages, the price of everything, lack of decent healthcare, the politics, oh my God. I’ve never felt sorry for Louisianans before but I really do now.

Listening to my uncle lament “you wonder why this keeps happening?” after his house is wrecked for the 4th time in 3 years after yet another severe weather event, and the whole town is out of power for multiple days in 90 degree temperatures, but if you mention climate change to any of these people they flip their shit. Also during my visit the Trump verdict came down and that made for some interesting dinner conversation with relatives.

Never mind the cost of a gallon a milk, or a months worth of car insurance, or the education system that is so dysfunctional and decrepit it’s bordering on child abuse IMO.

I know there are so many wonderful things about this state, but at what point is the crawfish etoufee and the jambalaya and the Big Ass Beers just not enough?

Louisiana,1cb7nuo,Louisiana is Going to Kill the Hemp Industry Eliminating Hundreds of Business and Thousands of Jobs. I run Crescent Canna. AMA.,"Yesterday the Senate passed SB237. This legislation completely eliminates the hemp industry in Louisiana that has been growing since the legislature passed pro-business and pro-hemp bills over the past few years.

There are 35 people that my companies employ in New Orleans whose jobs are now at risk if not certain to be eliminated. There are hundreds of other companies around the state that have built businesses around selling these products under the guidelines established by the Legislature and enforced by the ATC and LDH. Hundreds if not thousands of jobs will be eliminated

For what purpose?

Billionaires don't want small businesses to succeed because they perceive us as a threat to their power. Everything else is just talking points that they're using to justify their anti-free market and anti-business stances.

What will occur in the aftermath of this?

Jobs will be lost. Businesses will close. The state will further become a black hole for entrepreneurship and growing businesses. The state will lose millions in revenue in the short term and tens of millions in the long term, much of which goes directly to fund early childhood education. The black market will thrive. People who love these products won't be able to get them legally.

What can you do about it?

Call and email every single representative in the state house (and senate if you are able) and ask them politely to not kill jobs and small businesses, to support the free market, to support legal and safe hemp products, and to do what is right for the citizens of this state, not the billionaires who control it.",1713886579,461,https://www.reddit.com/r/Louisiana/comments/1cb7nuo/louisiana_is_going_to_kill_the_hemp_industry/,164,nolatime,,,Defense and National Security,151.3,396

Maine,183yzln,Things I learned since moving here,"At the risk of getting downvoted because I'm from away, I thought I'd share some things since my move here from the Pacific Northwest. I've been here about a year and a half now and am very grateful for the overwhelming welcome you guys have provided, but here's a few quirks you guys have.

You are expected to know who Chester Greenwood is and be wicked excited about celebrating earmuffs.

Mainer's are a crusty style of kind. Like they will help you change a tire on the side of the road, but make fun of you the whole time, (""""JFC bub. What Elementary school did you drop out of to not know this"""")

Folks from away will always out themselves because you guys have decided letters have nothing to do with pronunciation of places. I'm looking at you Topsham!

The state is very safe. Unless you start an argument over who makes the best Italian. That sort of talk is dangerous. 

Nobody effs with lobstermen. Nobody. When they don't like a new regulation,  congress actually passes bipartisan legislation in just a few weeks. It's astonishing.  

The term Downeast makes zero sense, unless you grew up here in which case it makes perfect sense.

Nobody bats an eye at the thought of putting up random roadside stands for various items completely on the honor system including selling WHOLE PIES 🥧 (Puzzle Mountain didn't disappoint).

I'm sure I'm missing lots of others that you will alert me of in the comments.",1700961691,575,https://www.reddit.com/r/Maine/comments/183yzln/things_i_learned_since_moving_here/,319,deleted,,,Government Operations and Politics,111.3,427

The man is a traitor to this country. He needs to be treated as such and the 14th Amendment states that he should be removed from the ballot since he committed treason.

Maine,1ew7g8a,I love my home state of Maine… and I hate this sub,"Thank you to the mods, who I’m sure work hard to monitor and keep the sub healthy… I mean you no offense! 


And also:


I find it very unwelcoming and poorly reflective of our beautiful state when people ask for recommendations (this happens to locals and out-of-staters alike!) and commenters tell them to eff off and then the mods refer them to an obsolete “megathread” that no one looks at. 

Can we please reconsider this  ugly part of this sub’s culture? Why not allow folks to uplift local businesses and drive business to certain areas if they want to? Why not celebrate all that Maine has to offer? This land is your land, this land is my land, etc etc. 

Reasons:

1)This is extremely standard in other town and state subs I follow, and people think of Reddit as a crowdsourcing resource so they aren’t and have no reason to be expecting to get a slap on the wrist. 

2) if you allow these threads to stay active, people can search for them instead of posting new similar posts, which will allow for fewer of these types of posts overall, and you’ll have a record of amazing recommendations… instead of a megathread that is not searchable and again, no one is seeing or looking at. 

3) It’s so curmudgeonly and small minded and embarrassing and makes us look bad when we treat people poorly simply for being enthusiastic about Maine. 


TL;DR the way recommendations are handled in this sub is uncool

Maine,1ajy3ty,"Apparently, Maine Isn't Part of the United States","So, have I got a live one for you ladies and gents.  

This happened to my husband just now.  We live in Maine, but we are currently in Washington state doing travel work in healthcare.  Now, full disclosure, we are from away.  I am a born and bred Montanan, but we have lived in Maine for almost 3 years.   Maine is our home and it's where we plan on living the rest of our lives. 

My husband went to get his Rx filled at the pharmacy and proceeded to have a 30-minute argument with the pharmacy tech.  My husband's point of view was that Maine is a state in the United States of America.  The tech disagreed, because Maine isn't in their system and insisted that he is sure it's not in the U.S. anyway.  They go back and forth and the tech recruits' reinforcements, and this guy says it's not a state at all it's a region of....  (God help me) Massachusetts.  

Eventually, they get it settled after bringing in a 3rd person who confirmed that yes, Maine is in The United States of America, it is, in fact its own state, and it absolutely is not part of Massachusetts.

I am not making this up.  This actually happened.  WTAH?!

I’m a kind person, but this is one road too far… It feels like a personal affront and is disgusting.  My house is set back from the road, but you can see it, as well as our neighbors (who deal with this constantly too).  Try walking on your lawn and finding human s&$t and sometimes toilet paper.

Long story short, I loved it here. If I ever move to America, it really is the only place I'd consider living. What a beautiful part of the world!

Here are some of my thoughts and questions all in one list:

1. Y'all are so happy, smiley and wavey all the time. Do you know how weird it would be if I was in the a UK store and the cashier greeted me with """"How are y'all doing, friend?""""
2. You call a roundabout a rotary here. I find that hilarious for some reason.
3. I was told that Whoopie Pies were great - what I wasn't told were that PUMPKIN whoopie pies are vastly superior to the chocolate kind.
4. Your country fair is so much fun. Did you know that there is almost no more sheep dog herding in New England? Please sort this out!
5. Trees. So many trees. I love it. The evergreens must look beautiful in the winter time! 
6. It's so spooky at night... love the stars though.
7. Crab > Lobster - fight me.
8. You have a distinct lack of Indian cuisine in Maine - couldn't find a curry outside of Portland.
9. This isn't specific to Maine, but sales tax can go to hell, or at least be included in the advertised price.
10. There was 2 hour free street parking in so many locations I went to - this is non-existent in populated areas in the UK,

So that's 5 beers total in about 3-4 hours. Now I have never blacked out my entire life. I have drank almost entire bottles of whiskey and still remember everything. I'm a dude that can hold my liquor. But I can't remember anything after drinking my 2nd beer at the bar. So, the last thing I remember is going outside to vape and leaveing my beer inside with my wife. She said it was behind her but she wasnt really paying attention. I came inside drank my beer while watching bad karaoke and thats all I remember. I woke up on my couch (I live an hour and a half away) not knowing how I got there. It's pretty frightening. I think someone may have drugged the beer think it was my wife's and I drank it. My wife said at some point I couldn't put a sentence together anymore, just kept mumbling, and I just kept falling over. If this is what really happened to me I'm glad it was me and not my wife.

Maryland,1gdc8jz,I want to share my story because my own husband didn't realize the true impact of question 1 until my aunt (who works in the hospital in surgery) helped me explain to him and he went through this with me.,"In 2015 I gave birth at full term to a perfectly healthy baby girl. After they had her cleaned up, etc is when the trouble started. It was discovered that I had placenta acreta. My placenta had attached too deeply into my uterine wall and wasn't coming unattached. They even went in manually and tried to remove it with their hands but it crumbled apart in pieces and started coming out like ground hamburger. This isn't a condition that with our current technology can be diagnosed with ultrasound unless the placenta burrows completely through the uterine wall so the only way it is discovered is after birth and it leads to massive hemmorhage because the uterus can't clamp down to stop the bleeding from labor.  Standard treatment is an emergency D&C to remove the placenta and any remaining tissue to control the bleeding. I was able to receive this life saving treatment, but even with it I lost 1/3 of my blood volume and it took me nearly 4 months to get back to full strength. And all this took place at 40 weeks of pregnancy/post birth.

When a woman, for whatever reason, whether it be miscarriage, fetal anomily, etc, requires a surgical termination of her pregnancy, the procedure done is also a D&C. 

When the hospital enters the procedure into your health records there is NO seperate Code or Procedure that would differentiate the two. They write the facts and that is it. Patient received This drug. Patient had this procedure. Patient was x weeks pregnant. Removed this tissue from uterus. Etc. 

By writing a law that would put a time limit on surgical abortions what is actually being banned is the D&C procedure and if the time limit is say 24 weeks, then women like myself who retain their placenta or other post partum tissue and hemmorhage, would be left to bleed to death or get sepsis and die. Even if the law is written to make exceptions for """"the life of the mother"""" we have already seen where doctors have been forced to wait and determine how close to death the woman has to be before they can intervene. You can't play games with lives like that. I remember that day in the hospital. I remember the midwife looking at my mother and in a whisper telling her that the placenta wasn't coming out and my cervix had closed and when my mother asked what that meant my midwife very seriously said """"your daughter could bleed to death."""" And my mother had to leave the room before she burst into tears. She came back barely holding it together with my grandmother and my father on the phone and held it up to my ear because I was so weak by then I couldnt do it myself and they both asked if I could hear them and told me to be strong because I had a new baby I couldnt leave behind. While the doctors were rushing around to prep me. Then they looked at my husband and told him. """"If you want to say goodbye now is your last chance to do it."""" 

And my husband leaned over and kissed me with tears in his eyes and squeezed my hand and told me he loved me. And I told him I would see him when I woke up. And then the doctors were racing me down the hallway but I passed out before we made it to the elevator. 

Now imagine that being your wife or your daughter only instead of it being the doctor saying they """"could"""" bleed to death they tell you that they are """"going"""" to bleed to death because they are 34 weeks or further along in their pregnancy and even though the baby is BORN and safely sleeping in the nursery, in the eyes of the law the life saving D&C is still an abortion because they are removing fetal tissue. That is what putting a time limit on abortions will ultimately cost. The lives of women and loved ones. We have already seen it in the news to two women in Georgua and while they were much earlier in their pregnancies, the life saving orocedure they needed was still the same one I had, a D&C and they didnt receive it because it was past the time limit that was set by lawmakers instead of the decision being left to the doctors in charge of her care.

I'm not asking you to change your mind on abortion I'm simply asking you to consider that it is impossible to write a law that sets a time limit that would also allow for exceptions for every possible medical emergency that could arise. Leave the doctoring to the doctors regardless of your personal faith or feelings on the matter and instead think what YOU would want the doctor to be allowed to do if YOU got the phone call that your child or wife was bleeding to death but they could save her vs if they were going to bleed to death and legally the doctors cant save them so you need to say your goodbyes because they are going to die.

3. Hogan [vetoed](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/maryland-larry-hogan-veto-abortion-access-bill/) a measure to expand **abortion** access by allowing nurse practitioners, nurse midwives, and physician assistants to perform the procedure.

Maryland,1g4pt4q,"Even if I believed Hogan's campaign texts, at this point I feel anything short of Alsobrooks being charged for a violent felony is unconvincing","Okay hear my rant out. 

I was a Republican until 2015. I'm a millennial suburban white lady who voted how my dad told me to vote and then voted how my husband told me to vote- I'm literally one of those. I guess I *was* one of those until I watched the Republican primary debate in 2015 and thought """"wow, that was a nightmare. I should look in to this shit more."""" After a few weeks of learning everything I could about political history (like, why stuff is the way it is) I switched my registration to Democrat. I went all the way left for a while as my little late 20s rebellion but I feel like I'm just someone who wants to vote for my kids to have a future.

In the presidential elections I've voted in, I've voted for McCain, Romney, Hillary, and Biden. I voted for Hogan in every election I can immediately remember until I voted for Moore. As I admitted to, my voter education was limited but I was overall happy with Hogan and felt like he was a really neat middle ground type of guy. Ive since learned plenty of shit about him but that's **not the point** in my very humble opinion.

My point is: even if Hogan was a sweet baby angel with a heart of gold who never did anything wrong and raised a billion dollars to rescue weird looking dogs, he's a Republican and it's 2024. It seems like a *really* fucking bad idea to have a Republican majority in the Senate at this point in time. idk but I feel like if he can't get along with his (majority) party, Maryland's priorities are going to to be low on the agenda unless he tows the line, fucking everyone over.

I guess he can keep sending me texts and mailers and buying all the YouTube ads but like... as an apparently targeted demographic I would be fine with Alsobrooks committing anything up to a violent felony and she's still got my vote. 

Edit: actually, in this country we believe in innocence until proven guilty so unless she's convicted of a violent felony before 11/5 I'm voting for her. And it's gotta be real sick and twisted with video proof and an admission of guilt- not just any old violent felony.

Maryland,1dbfhz5,The people of this state seem to hate people in poverty and it is starting to make me hate Maryland,"When Baltimore, the Western Counties, or the Eastern shore is brought up. There seems to be this common disdain or apathy for these regions which suffer high poverty levels. Statistically most people in this state have had an upper middle-class upbringing which is bound to create levels of misunderstanding for those in poverty.

For example, a lot of people will shut down potential solutions for the issues of Baltimore by saying something like """"It's too far gone, let the city die already"""" or something amongst those lines. Some people do attempt to offer solutions but nothing seems to be done because the state political establishment has a comfortable voter base that doesn't really demand change or action.

The Western counties and Eastern shore are also being gentrified by the tourism industry which is acting more as a parasite than an actual sector of the economy. Locals don't benefit from their land being bought out and consequentially housing, food, and everything else becomes more expensive in regions that already suffer higher than average levels of poverty. The average response from a downstater is criticizing these people for being Conservative or even belittling them like they are stupid. Arrogance such as this is very frequent on the sub itself.

I am not a Republican, so don't take this the wrong way. But this state seems to be filled with hypocritical Liberals that screech """"Vote blue no matter who"""" and then treat anyone in poverty with some weird level of classism, even reaching levels of soft racism when considering that a lot of the poor people in our state are black. When you start saying things like """"Baltimore has no culture, they're just all criminals"""" or some variation of that, you are being racist.

There are plenty of posts on here where someone from an impoverished portion of the state posts about their problems and 90% of responses seem to come from some Victorian nobles saying the worst possible things about the poor.

You may think your life is fine, but this state NEEDS bold political changes to succeed. The political establishment has become too complacent and change outside of stricter gun laws or the legalization of cannabis are never really brought up. When was the last time someone running for Governor made any specific plans for decent changes especially to eliminate poverty in the state?

We are in a position to completely eliminate poverty and become a beacon of American Democracy. And we are voting for the status quo in a country that is going through massive change (For better or for worse). So why don't we represent the better and not the worse? This post isn't about suggesting what changes to make, that is for you to think about. I am just saying there are problems that many people want to ignore, and when they are brought up the people who bring them up are scoffed at.

Maybe this sub is just really bad and I let it influence my opinion of the rest of the state too much. Sincerely, a Marylander in poverty.",1717888386,867,https://www.reddit.com/r/maryland/comments/1dbfhz5/the_people_of_this_state_seem_to_hate_people_in/,531,throwaway069420666,,,Health,192,747.6

Maryland,1e7142f,Why Hogan?,"Driving around I see a ton of Hogan signs. And just... why? Many of Hogan's Governor policies harmed this state.

Here's a smattering from Wikipedia:

* Expanded charter schools while reducing public school funding
* Canceled many public transit initiatives
* Spent $10 million! of tax-payer money on non-functional Covid tests
* Increased police funding and activated the Maryland National Guard against protestors
* Vetoed drug paraphernalia decriminalization
* Opposes abortion and refused to enshrine women's health rights into Maryland law

This man did so much harm to our state. When I was in high school we were ranked top 10 in education. Now we are #20. Traffic is worse with all the highway expansion projects. Hogan reduced corporate tax rates pushing the burden more onto the middle and working class. And to top it all off, he's vehemently pro-Israel.

Maryland,1dpbmzz,My experience in Maryland so far as a Texas intern,"About 2 months ago, I asked some questions about what Maryland would be like, because I would be spending my whole summer up here. I come from Texas by the way. I just wanted to share what my experience has been like so far. I will not be discussing anything political in this post, or in the comments.

**1. Traffic**

Maryland has, without exaggeration, the worst traffic I have ever experienced. I used to think that a 15 minute drive is a long drive, but now it's a short drive for me. A lot of my time is spent just sitting in my car without moving... on an expressway. While not as bad as I-35, traffic in Maryland is in general much worse than Texas.

A lot of this seems to be caused by bad traffic design, like having cloverleaf freeway interchanges and no access roads. There's also no dedicated U-turn lanes or turnarounds. However, this isn't really the fault of the government, because some of the roads are extremely old, and were built in a time period before they were widely used.

On the bright side, there aren't any lifted trucks here. All the people here who drive crazy are in small cars, and not in a giant F-150 that's like 8 feet off the ground. This has been an AMAZING change compared to where I live in Texas... there's idiots in lifted trucks everywhere.

**2. The Weather**

In my original post, people told me that I would be miserable and that """"it's not a dry heat"""". Honestly the weather here is MUCH nicer than where I live in Texas. Most of Texas has far more humidity than Maryland, and often gets much hotter. Also, Texas doesn't cool off at night. Some of my Maryland friends were complaining that it was 95F outside, which I thought was funny. xD

**3. The Food**

Maryland easily has way better seafood restaurants than anywhere in Texas. I tried a crab cake, and it was heaven in my mouth. Also, the oysters here are fresh, unlike in Corpus Christi. No seafood in Texas even comes close to the restaurants in Maryland.

Maryland's fast food is also not as greasy compared to Texas. I think that the food in Maryland is way healthier than in Texas. Even the Chick Fil A here doesn't have as much castor oil compared to the Chick Fil A in Texas.

However, there's no good BBQ or hot wing joints close to where I live in Maryland, which sucks. Also no Whataburger either. HEB doesn't exist up here either, and if you don't know, HEB is pretty much Whole Foods but with Walmart prices.

**4. Accessibility**

A lot of big stores like Bass Pro Shop and Dick's Sporting Goods are within driving distance. I'm used to having to drive 2 hours to get to Houston or San Antonio to go shopping or play Top Golf, but here, everything's wayyyy closer. This is definitely a nice change, and there's way more spots to hang out with people.

Also, there's like 3 different international airports that are all close to each other. That's not the same where I live in Texas... I would have to drive 2 hours to get to an airport xD

**Conclusion**

Honestly Maryland is not that bad of a place to be in once you get over the traffic. I'm pretty glad I'm spending my summer up here, and it's been great to experience a completely different part of the United States.",1719441273,1290,https://www.reddit.com/r/maryland/comments/1dpbmzz/my_experience_in_maryland_so_far_as_a_texas_intern/,498,HarukaKX,,,Health,192,747.6

This is a huge endorsement from our governor. Politics are dirty, greed ridden, and dishonest. VP Harris could have just been the one delegated to make the call to Moore, this could just be well constructed party line endorsement rhetoric, but

we see immediate action from the federal government supporting Maryland and Baltimore and the language Moore used —empathy— is important. 

“My endorsement today goes far beyond politics,” Moore said. 

“The morning that the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapsed, one of the first calls I received was from Vice President Harris.

She made clear that the entire nation stood with Maryland as we confronted one of the worst tragedies in the history of our state. 

In that moment, she demonstrated not just her powers of leadership, but also her powers of empathy.”

Empathy isn’t weakness.

Massachusetts,1f86u0l,One-party dominance is really bad for our state,"It’s depressing how few of our elected offices are seriously contested this year. I’d chalk up a lot of our state’s dysfunction - terrible MBTA, expensive housing, huge inequality - to the lack of competitive elections. Our elected leaders have no incentive to get stuff done. They just do nothing and get reelected. 

I think we could do a lot to improve our elections. Here are some thoughts: 

1. Different voting systems to make third parties more viable. Perhaps we could have another go at ranked choice? Or a jungle primary, as in California?

2. For Democrats - have more democrats running in primaries against sitting officials. It would be great to have more moderate vs progressive competitions, or competitions against unproductive officials  

3. For Republicans - run more candidates in general, and run moderates like Charlie Baker

4. Split our electoral college votes like Maine and Nebraska do to encourage presidential candidates to campaign here. To be clear, I don’t think it would change anything, at least for this election. But I do think it would be worth it to incentivize smaller campaign efforts. Or maybe there is some other way of making our presidential votes count for more! 

5. Term limits for elected officials! 

Please share your thoughts! I mean this to be a nonpartisan post. 

Edit: I also want to clarify that I do not think our state is bad. However, I think it could be a lot better. This is also not just a call for more competition from Republicans. I think our state could benefit from more competition on the left, whether within the Democratic Party, or from other parties further to the left ",1725386842,796,https://www.reddit.com/r/massachusetts/comments/1f86u0l/oneparty_dominance_is_really_bad_for_our_state/,915,Bendragonpants,,,Health,294,673.9

Massachusetts,1frzypx,I'm Tired of the Anti-Question 5 Astroturfing/Propaganda on this Sub,"Hi, longtime lurker here. I'm so sick of the anti-Question 5 astroturfing/propaganda that has been magically appearing on this sub from supposed """"servers"""" and """"bartenders"""" who are telling people to vote No on Question 5 on Nov. 5th, 2024.

Here's what voting Yes on Question 5 actually does according to Ballotpedia:

""""A """"yes"""" vote supports gradually increasing the wage of tipped employees until it meets the state minimum wage in 2029 and continues to permit tipping in addition to the minimum wage"""" (Ballotpedia, n.d.).

In other words, a Yes Vote on Question 5 supports increasing the current minimum wage of tipped workers in MA from $6.75/hour + tips to $15/hour + tips (Ballotpedia, n.d.)!

QUESTION 5 DOESN'T OUTLAW TIPPING (Ballotpedia, n.d.)!

QUESTION 5 DOESN'T MANDATE THE CREATION OF TIPPING POOLS (Ballotpedia, n.d.)!

PASSING QUESTION 5 WILL INCREASE THE WAGES OF TIPPED WORKERS, NOT DECREASE THEM (Gould & Cooper, 2018)!

According to a fact-sheet by Elise Gould and David Cooper titled """"Seven facts about tipped workers and the tipped minimum wage"""", published by the Economic Policy Institute, a non-profit economic policy think-tank, PEOPLE WILL STILL TIP AND HAVE CONTINUED TO TIP IN STATES THAT HAVE PASSED BALLOT MEASURES SUCH AS QUESTION 5 (Gould & Cooper, 2018)!

In another fact-sheet titled """"Ending the tipped minimum wage will reduce poverty and inequality"""", by Justin Schweitzer, a policy analyst for the Center for American Progress, another non-profit economic policy think tank, studies show that States which passed ballot measures such as Question 5, reduced income inequality and poverty among tipped-workers/working-class people (Schweitzer, 2021)!

If you're a worker/server who is Voting No on Question 5, YOU ARE VOTING AGAINST YOUR OWN CLASS INTEREST!

And before anyone gives me the tired """"restaurants are required to make up wages of tipped workers by law if they don't make enough"""" line, then how come tipped workers make up the majority of wage-theft victims (Gould & Cooper, 2018)?

Restaurants knowingly violate wage-theft laws regularly because wage-theft laws are extremely hard to enforce (Gould & Cooper, 2018).

Passing Question 5 solves the problem of wage-theft for tipped workers because it will eliminate the current two-tier wage structure that currently separates tipped and non-tipped workers.

Lastly, to the people astroturfing this sub and spreading anti-Question 5 lies/MA Restaurant Association propaganda, and you know who you are, you are awful and evil for doing so. Stop polluting this sub with your anti-worker garbage.

To the people who question me or call me a bot based on my account's age, just because your account may be ancient, doesn't mean mine has to be as well in order to contribute to a topic such as this.

Personal Edit #4: Hi all, I just want to remind you all that I can't respond to every single reply to this post; I'm only human. To the people who replied and want others to Vote No on Question 5, many of the anecdotal counter-arguments you've been making have already been addressed by my OG post.

Massachusetts,1ggv59d,I cannot wait for this election cycle to end.,"Its been all over social media, the news, family discussions, the workplace, out anywhere in public, and the list goes on. Regardless of what candidate you support, I feel like elections have been draining since Obama left office. 

Maybe I was young and did not pay attention enough. Maybe I just thought things would “work out” for the best…that the real adults would get it right. 

Part of me believes it will slow down once a candidate is elected…another part of me believes this may be the new norm. 

I guess I’m venting because this has occupied so much of my mind recently. I don’t want it to, but I do not believe an election has been this divided and “in your face” since I’ve been alive. Younger me had an ill-conceived notion that everyone was looking out for each other and these past years have shown me otherwise. 

I apologize for the rant. I hope someone else feels the same sentiment. I just don’t understand how we got here. 

I’m just tired, boss.

Massachusetts,1fl06tv,Seriously Eastern Mass what’s your long term plan?!?!?,"I grew up in the Southcoast of Massachusetts, lived in Boston for a while then went back to the Southcoast to Mattapoisett. Sadly I live NY now since 2019 when my wife got a good job out here. My question is how the fuck can anyone other than tech, finance or doctors live in the eastern part of the state anymore!?!?!? 

Like my wife and I both do well (or at least what I thought was well growing up) making over 100k a year each but I feel like it’s an impossible task to move back one day. Between student loans, the cost of childcare and the ridiculous housing costs how are normal people with normal jobs able to afford to live there?? Like even a shitty shitty ass house that would have been maybe 100-200k max back pre 2019 is now going for like 500k and will need another 150k work. And a normal semi nice 3 br 2 bath? Oh a very affordable 700-800k, or 1 million plus as soon as it’s sniffing Boston’s ass from 40 mins away. 

So I ask once again Massachusetts, wtf is your plan?? Do you plan to just have no restaurants, no auto shops, no tradespeople, no small businesses, no teachers, no mid to low level healthcare workers and just be a region of work from home tech and finance people?? I’m curious how exactly that’s gonna work in 10-20 years. 

Seriously, how the fuck is that sustainable?

Edit: and yes I agree the NIMBYism is a big problem in mass. There’s gotta be a happy medium between not having shitty sec 8 apartments with all the issues that come with that and zero places for working class people to live. For fucks sake there’s so much money and talent and education is this state why the hell can’t we figure this out? 

Edit edit: apparently people can’t read a whole post so once again this isn’t so much about me and my wife having trouble (although it still will be very challenging as we only starting making this higher income in the past 2 years and all cash offers above asking will still make us lose out on most homes) it’s about people with more modest-lower incomes working jobs that while “less skilled” at times are nonetheless still very important to a well rounded commonwealth.

Many of you are all over the threads writing cheeky comments about how you don’t claim your tips and I remembered this being a huge thing when I served as well, but others don’t really know it. 

So I added another piece of why the current system isn’t working and it’s FROM YOUR OWN “MOUTHS”. But I see this post hit a nerve with many of you. Remember this post is taken from what servers are writing on here in the comments 🤷‍♂️

Edit 2: did you know that tipping started in Europe and the practices were brought to the US. It was so hated that an anti tipping movement propelled that was so strong it made its way back to Europe where it stuck, which is why there’s no tipping culture like here. Americans protested that tipping is Anti American, but surprise surprise 😮 corporations loves not having to pay labor so they made sure any and all legislation removing tipping was squashed. 

Tipping IS anti-American. Our ancestors knew it and fought, now it’s time to bring the movement back once and for all.

Massachusetts,1g4hm9p,Why I support Question 5 as a MA native,"I'm an Arlington native who now lives in Central VT, and works at a non-tipped restaurant job. Because we are in a tourist area, competition for labor is fierce, and employers actually have to pay us well and give decent benefits. We have a 401(k) match with no vesting period, annual profit sharing, and the best health insurance I've ever had. Part of this is because the owners are decent humans, but mostly it is because they actually have to work to attract and retain workers.

If you vote to extend the minimum wage to all workers, you can put the responsibility back onto employers to compensate their employees fairly, and start to dismantle the classist tipping economy.

The idea that this proposal is an existential threat to the restaurant industry is debunked by the existence of many non-tipping economies around the world.",1729024298,762,https://www.reddit.com/r/massachusetts/comments/1g4hm9p/why_i_support_question_5_as_a_ma_native/,473,mobert_roses,,,Health,294,673.9

Massachusetts,1fc67ga,99 is underrated,"Idk if it’s just the ones near me, but there’s something about 99. They’re chill, they’ve got consistent food, and they’re cheap. 

It’s the closest thing we have to a regular British pub. There’s a lot of places that have a bar and a restaurant but they feel more like one or the other. At 99 you can sit at the bar, get some food, watch the game and not be inundated by exceptionally loud music. It’s like the perfect line between the two. 

It’s just a great place to chill where you don’t feel pressured to buy more or get out the door.

The food is great too. It’s consistently above average and with sizable portions too. Great deals especially during games and throughout the week. 

The drinks are cheap which is nice because it feels like everything costs $14 these days. The angry orchard with the cinnamon sugar rim is the perfect Fall drink btw.

Michigan,1dcse9o,Would people support a ballot initiative to block corporate ownership of houses?," For the last decade I’ve worked in real estate. As an underwriter, loan office, and eventually running a brokerage. Over the last few years I’ve watched many of my clients and heard of the clients of others in my community losing out on houses because a large investor came in with cash.

This seems to be a growing trend across the country. I’m of the mind that houses should go to families first, lest we become a state of renters. 

So here’s what I’m proposing, houses can’t be owned by companies (asterisks). I see no issue in companies buying houses that are in disrepair to flip to sell. I also know builders own houses for a bit and think new construction could be excluded from a ban. 

Basically make it so that houses can only be held long term by individuals. 

So Michigan, what am I missing? I know trusts and landlords that put houses into a llc could get sticky. What else? Is this even a good idea?

The thing is with how polarizing this election is what is the point of all of this? Are there really any undecided voters out there still? Is anyone seriously going to vote based on a flyer they got in the mail or a ad they saw on TV?

I don't call PD if I find like an old, rust coated revolver or rifle/shotgun. I will turn over more recent finds or something that could be salvageable for evidence (found 2 confirmed homicide weapons, potentially a third one recently that Lansing PD was looking for) 

The firearms in the pictures below were the ones I found that I tried to turn over to Flint PD. I even tried through going to their police station, they rejected any firearm I've tried to turn in... I do end up finding ways to turn them over to my local police station, but I definitely don't wanna happened to be pulled over with stuff like that in the car and try to explain to an officer that I found them in a river then potentially get arrested anyways...

Michigan,1gc15i9,What happen to Rural Michigan?,"I’m from the Thumb originally, I currently live in Detroit. I just spent the week in Isabella/Saginaw/Midland County for work and I noticed this happening in the thumb previously, now mid Michigan too.

People have no manners, there is a stark difference in the friendliness and politeness of Michiganders here and in Metro/Downtown Detroit.

Being from this area, when prompted I would’ve said people here were polite and kind to one another, but the level of of civility and friendliness in rural Michigan is embarrassingly absent.

So for my mid-Michiganders, I ask: why are you so miserable that you’ve abandoned your civility? Isn’t it embarrassing that the former murder capital has maintained their core American values better than you? 

Think I’m being dramatic? Head over to r/Detroit and read the feedback from visitors, constant compliments on community, manners, and kindness. Out of the 14 doors I held open for people at gas stations and restaurants in the last 24 hours, I received 0 thank you’s. A pathetic show of character imo. No wonder the populations up here are collapsing left and right, no way in hell I’d raise my family in a community with such low civility standards and disregard for their fellow man. 

For the record: I’m a cis white former farm boy, these are my folks, so it isn’t some prejudice I’m not aware of. I look like they do. 

Edit: I really didn’t want this to be political, if your only answer is to blame either party, or candidate, let’s shelf it - we’re mostly on the same team here and the points been made, and made again. Let’s focus on everything else.",1729880878,1158,https://www.reddit.com/r/Michigan/comments/1gc15i9/what_happen_to_rural_michigan/,1123,aDrunkenError,,,Government Operations and Politics,238.6,1112
Michigan,18pas6w,State representatives are asking to remove the Satanic Temple holiday display in the capitol,"Full text below:

Members of the Capitol Commission, 

Yesterday, we became aware of a recent, undated memo bearing the letterhead of Michigan State Representative Neil Friske decrying the recent inclusion of a holiday display provided by several local congregations of The Satanic Temple at the State Capitol. The letter calls for the removal of the Satanic display while advancing no coherent legal theory to mitigate the open and obvious affront to the First Amendment posed by the demand. Worse, the letter is co-signed by seven additional state representatives who are apparently equally contemptuous and/or unaware of the most basic fundamental principles of constitutional law and democracy.

Ironically, the letter states, """"As elected representatives of our respective districts, we are entrusted with upholding the values and principles that our nation was built upon."""" Though Friske comes to the non sequitur conclusion that sucha mandate demands that our display be taken down, """"upholding the values and principles that our nation was built upon"""" demands that our display remain. For our nation was founded upon principles of Religious Liberty and Free Expression, nor were the founders of our republic unclear in how expansive these liberties were envisioned to be. Thomas Jefferson wrote in A Bill For Establishing Religious Freedom (1779) that """"all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain their opinions in matters of religion, and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge, or affect their civil capacities."""" In his memoirs, Jefferson clarified, """"protection of opinion was meant to be universal,"""" [and the document included] """"within the mantle of its protection the Jew and the Gentile, the Christian and Mahometan, the Hindoo, and infidel of every denomination.""""

Citing vague concerns for """"good and morality,"""" Friske fails to demonstrate any evidence that he knows anvthing gbout The Satanic Temple, our ethics and yalves, or the megning of our symbols before denouncing them as """"representing hatred or evil."""" One can only conclude that Friske penned his letter not only in complete ignorance of who The Satanic Temple are, but in complete ignorance of the oath of office he swore to uphold, the spirit of which should surely lead one to accept that symbols causing him discomfort in a public square are far lesser an """"evil"""" than a government imbued with the ability to regulate matters of religious Conscience.

Irrelevant to the question of our religiouS sovereignty and Free Speech, but worth mentioning here, The Satanic Temple happens to believe in liberal democratic ideals as items of religious conviction, with Satan being an icon for Enlightenment values. One may protest that we have chosen inappropriate symbols for these values, but it is incontrovertible that Friske and his co-signatories agreed to uphold those values when they took public office. Their letter calls their competence as public officials into serioUS question.

We urge the Capitol Commission to address Friske's public campaign to subvert the public understanding of its function, and to remind the public, as well as the Michigan House of Representatives, that ours is a nation of laws in which pluralism will always prevail over petty partisan demagoguery.",1703353319,1314,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/18pas6w,356,Trentskiroonie,,,Health,238.6,1112

First of all, this is gonna be heavy. 

My siblings and I are all in our 30s, born in the mid 80s to early 90s in Midland and mid-Michigan. There are four of us. The youngest was diagnosed with Stage 3 colon cancer in February. Doctors said we all need to get screened, but there isn’t a genetic component that explains the youngest’s cancer. It’s more likely environmental. 

I went in and had two polyps removed and biopsied. One was precancerous. 

My oldest brother went in and had a polyp removed. Also precancerous. 

The last sibling hasn’t gotten screened yet. 

This isn’t normal. 

I’m looking for others in their 30s, born or raised in Midland who have been diagnosed with cancer. There’s gotta be something more going on…

Edit: We’ve done genetic testing. There is no Lynch Syndrome or other genetic markers that indicate he would get this. The best we got is a mutation for breast cancer.

Minnesota,1e08w4c,Took the Borealis from St Paul to Chicago and back. My thoughts (which aren’t worth much),"Took my daughter to Chicago for a couple days and decided to take the new train.  Booked business class there, coach for the return just to see the difference in experience.  Total round trip cost for 2, $137.   Fairly empty train on the way there, packed full (till the Dells) on the way back.  Which is probably cheaper for me than driving (jeep gets maybe 17 mpg on a good day with a good tailwind) with gas and tolls l/paying for parking, factored in.  We stayed right near the Shedd and Field museum so walked aside from a bus to the hotel.  

Start with, difference between business and peasant class isn’t much.  Get on the train first, seats are a smidge bigger.  Seats in peasant class are plenty big, bigger than normal airline seats.  

WiFi is pretty shitty, and there are dead spots for cell coverage in some of the ruraler (new word I made up) areas.  Bring a book.  

Trip there was easy, 7 hours or so.  Little longer than driving, depending on pee stops.  Trip back we were delayed an hour and a half due to mechanical issues, so that sucked.  Info at the Chicago union depot was garbage.  Likely to arrive back in St Paul a hour and a half late.  

My only real gripe aside from the delay on the way back is I think they could cut out a few stops, stops in some small WI towns, one or two could be cut out, and twice in Milwaukee, could cut that to just one.  (I’m sure there is a reason they do this so this is just me bitching).


Anyways probably will go again, stress free once in the train, might try just a Dells trip as well since it’s a stop and takes about as much time as driving.   Views are fantastic from St. Paul through lacrosse.

Minnesota,1eu3ccn,Our Harris / Walz Sign has been up for 2 days. Twice people have tried to take it down....,"Infuriating.

Unfortunately our doorbell camera doesn't catch the sign, because of some bushes.

First, I was in my office which has a clear view of the yard and a car pulled up I didn't recognize and they grabbed the sign. I ran downstairs and confronted the person who threw it on the street and tore off. They had other signs in their piece of shit white dodge minivan. 

Second, today, a *preteen aged girl* whom we KNOW rolled up on her bike. I had my windows open and heard her say """"you have got to be fucking kidding me"""" and she got her phone out, started taking pictures, then got off the bike and started walking up to the sign. I yelled """"leave it alone"""" and she panicked and scrambled off.

I am blown away by this. 

People are weird. I would never in my life consider ripping out a yard sign.



Edit: for those wondering, yes I did get the plate and call it in. And no i did not reach out to the parents of the kid. They are one of those families that has 5+ kids, homeschooling while the dad makes the big bucks. I'd likely get shouted at vs anything productive. 


Edit 2: we slapped a walz sticker on a Harris sign since the joint ones weren't available 





Edit 3: im in the SW metro. I setup another cam, just in case. I've gotten some nice DMs from Trump supporters saying they apologize on behalf of the degenerates. I've also gotten some doxxing threats from burner accounts I'm just ignoring. One person said I was lying and they would dox me if I didn't update my post with proof.

Minnesota,1gb8s64,"As a Minnesotan regardless of your political side, if Trump wins, Minnesota loses","I say this not to be mean or to try to get you to vote for Harris and Walz though personally I do support them. 

I say this because Trump is known to go after his political opponents however he can. We saw this in his last presidential term as he repeatedly withheld funding that was authorized by Congress to states that disagreed with it like California. 

Given that Walz is the VP candidate for the Democrats and what Trump and Vance have said about Walz, it should not be surprising that if Trump wins, there is a good chance that he will try to direct any kind of federal funding that Minnesota is entitled to to other states such as the Dakotas in Iowa. We as a state need to be prepared that FEMA might not be there for us and that Trump may direct his attorney's general to go after any kind of legislation that Minnesota passes or has passed such as the state trying to protect the Boundary Waters from pollution.

This election is probably one of the most important elections for Minnesota in a long time given the nature of the candidates.

The only way to ensure that Minnesota wins is to ensure that Trump loses.

Minnesota,1d2tcut,"Minnesota Bans """"Gay/Trans Panic"""" Defense","""""On Friday, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz signed into law HF5216, a judiciary, public safety, and corrections supplemental budget bill that includes a ban on the gay and trans panic defense. The law, which narrowly passed the Senate on a party-line 34-33 vote, prohibits individuals who commit violence against gay or trans people from using their surprise at the victim's identity as a justifiable reason for their actions. This defense has been used at least 351 times in homicide trials, according to researchers, and has often led to reduced sentences. Now, Minnesota becomes the 19th state to bar such defenses.

The bill states that the use of force against a person in reaction to their sexual orientation or gender identity is prohibited. It also specifies that it is not a defense to any crime that the defendant acted """"based on the discovery of, knowledge about, or disclosure of"""" a victim's LGBTQ+ status. Such defenses have been used previously to justify violence against transgender people who do not disclose their gender identity to an intimate partner, romantic partner, or even during mere flirtation.

Conservative lawmakers want to take away our public lands and sell them to private interests, without any interest in conservation or regulation. Imagine a future where Minnesotans, or Americans at large, can no longer enjoy the majesty that is the BWCA, because the land has been leased to logging, mining, and fracking companies.

I implore everyone to look into Project 2025. It affects us so much more than just our national parks and forests, but I feel that should be a point hammered home to Minnesotans, who hold our parks and public lands as a point of state pride.

MS Private School  is immediately going to raise tuition to $800. School makes a nice tidy profit. Family A still pays the original $500 thanks to the voucher.  But Family B *still* doesn’t get in because they’re still priced out. 

Vouchers are a scam. Stop stealing from public schools. Instead of creating more academies of religion and segregation, follow your tax dollars and demand improvement of your local public schools. Raise teachers who attended those schools. Reinvest in your community. Participate in the process. *And stop reporting this post for self harm. Weirdos.*",1712228865,533,https://www.reddit.com/r/mississippi/comments/1bvke3d/heres_an_eli5_explainer_as_to_why_private_school/,212,NegroMedic,,,Health,91,202.3

The following link is a document detailing voter ID requirements and how to get a free voter ID card if you do not have a government-issued ID. There appears to be a lot of options. Start the process now rather than later. You need to be registered 30 days before the election in order to vote.

[https://www.sos.ms.gov/sites/default/files/voter\_id/FAQ\_Voter\_ID.pdf](https://www.sos.ms.gov/sites/default/files/voter_id/FAQ_Voter_ID.pdf)

IMPORTANT: Also, when I converted my driver's license recently from out of state, a young man and his mother were also at the DMV to get his license. The clerk asked him if he wanted to register to vote. He said yes. I have to wonder if he really is registered. I called my local circuit clerk's office to make sure I was registered through the DMV. The lady there said registration through the DMV is hit or miss, and she confirmed that I was NOT registered. She mailed me a registration form, and I sent that puppy back today.

IF YOU REGISTERED TO VOTE THROUGH THE DMV, call your courthouse to make sure you are in fact registered. You might not be.

Missouri,17wy024,"Transgender minors sue University of Missouri for refusing puberty blockers, hormones"," Two transgender boys filed a federal lawsuit Thursday seeking to reverse the University of Missouri’s decision to stop providing gender-affirming care to minors. The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri, alleges halting transgender minors’ prescriptions unconstitutionally discriminates on the basis of sex and disability status.

... University of Missouri Health announced Aug. 28 that it would no longer provide puberty blockers and hormones to minors for the purpose of gender transition. The decision was based on a new law[ banning transgender minors from beginning gender-affirming care](https://missouriindependent.com/briefs/missouri-governor-signs-ban-on-gender-affirming-care-restrictions-for-trans-athletes/). It included a provision to allow people those already receiving treatment to continue, but some providers stopped completely because of a clause included in the new law that they feared opened them to legal liability.

... \[ J. Andrew Hirth, an attorney for the plaintiff\] says he filed the case in federal court because the University of Missouri “receives millions of dollars in federal financial assistance every year” and is subject to the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act “prohibits discrimination in any health program or activity on the grounds of sex or disability.”

Missouri,1b1bxkg,I'm a Republican. And I Cannot Vote For Trump,"&#x200B;

In the Republican caucus this week, I am not going to be able to support the candidacy of Donald Trump.

As Republicans, we believe in upholding the Constitution and the rule of law.  Yet Trump attempted to subvert the Constitution by trying to get Mike Pence to nullify the will of the electors.  He additionally put pressure on state election officials to find him more votes or not certify results. 

Now, unbelievably, Trump is trying to defend his reprehensible conduct by arguing that, unless the President is found guilty in an impeachment trial, he can’t be held liable for crimes committed in office.  Think about that.  Trump actually thinks the President should be above the law.

Trump has a long history of immoral, unethical, and dishonest behavior that, if engaged in by a Democrat, Republicans would be calling for his ouster.  So why are we giving Trump a pass? 

Do we no longer believe “character matters?”  Is it now just about advancing our agenda by any means possible?  If we nominate Trump again it will show we are a party that has lost its moral compass, and is not deserving of the trust of the American people.

The story goes he had taken over 300k of their money and dumped it into the orange blobs truth social nonsense. Of course it tanked. But the kicker is it wasn't his money I guess to begin with. 

Anyway, from what we heard through the txt chain is she filed, got a damn good attorney, and in less than 70 days it was done.

He was screaming and cussing as the police escorted him off the property. From what we could see he had some clothes, his old motorcycle and crap, and a couple boxes of junk.

Montana,18f7uyv,I've been working in Butte and I think people are completely wrong about it,"All I read about Butte, or hear about Butte, before I even lived in Montana--was negative portrayals of the place. I deliver in Butte, so for 8 hours a day I drive all over the city and interact with tons of people. And I like the place.

When I'm out and about nobody has been unfriendly, I haven't felt threatened. Even the homeless people I've interacted with were cool.

But what I love about the city is uptown. I was reading how its one of the largest historic district in the United States, with over 6000 historic buildings-- many that are used for distilleries, coffee shops, Asian cuisines, dispensaries, galleries, hotels etc.. I love the vibe of it. Plus all the Victorian homes to boot.

I imagine Butte will be gentrified in the coming decades and a lot of the dilapidated homes and businesses with see new life. Every time I'm uptown, especially at night, I like to imagine how even more beautiful the city would look if more money was to pour in those late 19th century and early 20th buildings and homes.

Edit: i'd go as far to say that people that shit on butte, don't' realize what you have. If you haven't lived outside of Montana, you've likely not experienced how shitty so much of our country is. I grew up in Flint mi, the city where they poisoned their own residents with dirty lead water, so i promise you Butte is not as bad as you think.

When they were done the doctor called me, we didn’t want our toddler at the hospital for an extended period of time, and said my wife had lost over a liter of blood and that it would have quickly progressed to a life & death situation for her without intervention. 

While my wife is from Montana, I’m from Idaho. We met while we were both living in Idaho and moved here 3 years ago, something I’m always grateful for but that gratitude is much more profound today. The outcome could have been very different, and devastating, if we still lived there.

You know they’re just using us as a stepping stone before leaving us in the dust and going elsewhere, right?

Montana,17z1hua,Letter from UM Band director reported by media to be sent out after Brawl of the Wild game yesterday.,">Great job today GMB! It was too loud in the stadium for me to pass along information that I think you need to know. I want to explain why we didn't play as much as we normally do.
>
>Last night, around 1:30am, I was sent a message from Athletics Marketing. They handle the Griz Vision and PA's, canned music, etc. They informed me that the GMB would not be allowed to play when the team was on defense. Also, they indicated that they would be canceling the fight song after a score during the game so that they could play Cotton Eye Joe instead.
>
>The short answer to this - and the answer we got from them when Dr. Smart went and confronted them during lunch - is that they feel canned music pumps up the crowd more and is more interesting than the band music. You know that I find that to be a ridiculous opinion and I will fight for you and the role you play at the games. I didn't want to tell you about this before the game started because we needed to be positive and professional in our approach. I didn't want the whole band to be as angry as I have been all day. You needed to have a great day watching the team dominate the biggest game of the year!
>
>I will continue to fight against this attitude and make sure that you are properly represented as UM students and members of the Grizzly Marching Band. College sports are not about canned music and selling stuff at every turn. We are the most important musical element in the stadium on game day and I'm going to make sure that Athletics remembers and acknowledges it. The person responsible for the offensive and ignorant attitude regarding our participation is Nick Hallisey - Associate AD (Marketing and Communications). The GMB will continue to take the higher ground and remain the professionals in this fight. There are many ways that we can respond to this and I think that more people need to know that they are now trying to cut us out of participation at our own home games.",1700413113,231,https://i.redd.it/5pq9grf75c1c1.jpg,108,deleted,https://storage.googleapis.com/policy_posse_reddit_images/reddit_post_images/17z1hua.jpg,https://storage.googleapis.com/policy_posse_reddit_images/reddit_post_images/17z1hua.jpg,Defense and National Security,47.3,222

Each update seems worse than the last, and you keep expecting someone, anyone, to put on the brakes.  Then, nothing happens.  This painful true in Nebraska, a state slowly transitioning away from 'old school' Republicans into the modern version of their party.

The gears are turning for a huge power grab, also known as Project 2025, which will politicize and replace 50k federal employees.  Today's SCOTUS ruling has to be the last straw for some of us.  Pledging to vote and then crossing your fingers isn't enough.  You have to Protect 2025, starting at home.

If you have the means, I implore you to take an active role in our government, whether that is volunteering for events, contributing time to a campaign staff, or look into a future election yourself.

You can start heer at The Blue Bench Project, which provides tools and guidance to get started.  The website also offers other avenues to take action.

https://nebraskademocrats.org/take-action/blue-bench-project/

Nebraska,1duksi4,A Nebraskan kid about 17 beat up a Danish guy in a Copenhagen bar for talking shit about American rednecks. I found it amusing and just didn't know who to share it with so here it goes lol,"No question, just an incident I witnessed I found very funny.

&#x200B;

I'm a Danish girl and was sat in a bar on the weekend with some friends. It's actually not that touristy and you don't get many non-Danes. Anyway, this teenage boy, looked 17-18 with an American accent (we later found out he was Nebraskan) kind of barged over this local guy about my age (21-22) while placing a drinks order. 

&#x200B;

Danish guy got upset but didn't say anything to his face, but started mumbling about him having no manners to his friend (in Danish) so Nebraska guy doesn't understand it. But he's not being subtle and keeps pointing at him. After a little bit Nebraskan goes up to him and says """"do we have a problem here?"""" Danish guy quickly says no, but as SOON as Nebraska kid turns around he mumbles """"Fucking hillbilly redneck bitch"""".

&#x200B;

What he fails to realise is that that phrase is the same in Danish or English lol, and the Nebraskan kid turned around and punches him square in the jaw so hard he knocks him off his stool. Danish boy tries to throw a punch but Nebraskan is sitting on his chest in a second, left hand on his throat while the other punches his across the face HARD three or four times. 

&#x200B;

Our Danish man is now trying hard not to cry and there's blood coming down his face when Nebraskan pulls him up by his collar and says """"get the fuck outta here bitch"""". Bar sat in stunned silence; no one had actually moved a muscle to stop the fight. 

&#x200B;

I learned two things that day, one to never underestimate the patrotism of a middle American. The other is that the Danish guy will probably look over his shoulder before saying redneck for the rest of his life. 

&#x200B;

Sometimes it feels like nothing ever happens in Copenhagen, and now that something did, I wanted to share it with the people who made it possible lol  ",1720029496,442,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nebraska/comments/1duksi4/a_nebraskan_kid_about_17_beat_up_a_danish_guy_in/,381,throwra1nightstand,,,Government Operations and Politics,90,271

Nevada,1enou7q,"Stopped in Primm NV, it was one of the weirdest experiences I’ve had. ","Sometime in 2021 my mom and I took a trip to Vegas and stopped in Primm for a much needed bathroom and coffee brake. As we pulled out of Starbucks, we took a moment to look at the roller coaster from a distance. I saw there was parking lot that would open up to the back of the roller coaster, So we decided to head over and check it out (this was before I googled and found it had been out of service for awhile) We found a car parked in the back that seemed beat up. Upon closer inspection, the car had a note on it with bright orange paper. There was a construction hat in the windshield and that was all we could see from driving by.  My mom wanted to check it out because we couldn’t see the writing and I was noooot into that.  We both have Fire and EMS background so there was a little concern someone may need help.

She checked the note and I, the backseats. There was nobody in the back and the note said the car had broken down and someone would be back for it. Normal enough. What’s not normal is that after we got back in the car and started driving out, an all white pickup truck came racing up behind us in this parking lot and getting close enough to hit us. We were really confused and made a move to get the hell out of there because it felt like…intimidation? I thought it also might’ve been a teenager or something dicking around but I wasn’t taking chances. The truck turned a corner, and was in the normal flow of traffic away from us. 

When leaving that lot, we passed by a casino directly leaving the roller coaster lot. There were two huge semi trucks backed into the loading bay of this casino, both Pepsi big haulers unloading. This will be important later. When we went to leave to get back on the road to Vegas, there were two White trucks tinted windows and no license plates (same as the one before) in the parking lot nearest to us facing the road to turn. When we went straight to get onto the roundabout, they followed. We went around TWICE and they followed. By this point, we were a little freaked but not into being intimidated and a little dumb probably. We decided to park in the big mall to see if they were cops and maybe were wanting to talk to us. Soon as we parked, they passed and left the mall lot. We couldn’t see either of them the windows were so dark. 

We went into the mall. We were both a little freaked and wanted to ask some questions to the workers as they were probably local. This mall was definitely dead. We went into Tommy Bahama, and talked to the clerk about the deal with the roller coaster. She said it’s hasn’t been up and running for a while. I asked her why there were two casinos right across from each other, she said the roof partially collapsed on one of them and left it unusable for a while and that she didn’t know why there were two but that it was a good idea given only one works. I asked her which one collapsed, she told me the one closest to the roller coaster.  

The same casino that was partially collapsed is the one that I saw had two semis backed into the loading dock with people actively unloading things. Why would there be two semis with workers unloading from a “Pepsi” truck into a non working casino? We left the mall, got into the car to leave for Vegas as we had been in Primm for about an hour. Driving away, there were Two white pickups, and a small white car quite literally pulling into the lot as we are leaving, turning around driving in a line and followed us to the roundabout to get onto the on ramp. Once we got onto the highway, they did not follow and stayed on the roundabout. 

Listen, is there some shady shit going on over there or were people just fucking with us? I think about this a lot and my mom and I have talked about it quite a bit. It’s been awhile but it won’t leave my mind.

NewHampshire,1bvq8b7,Confronted hate speech overheard in Home Depot (West Lebanon) yesterday. A little bit rattled. Just venting and looking for support.,"Was picking up some vacuum accessories yesterday and overheard a """"conversation"""" between a painter (male, 50s) and a retired nurse (I think) from DHMC (female, 40/50s). 

Basically consisted of him complaining about his life not being where he wants it to be, how he pictured """"owning two pieces of land when in my 30s, and I'm 50 and don't even own anything!"""". At first I sympathized with the lady, thinking he was just offloading on this poor woman. But the conversation grew more sinister and she never pushed back-- all the classic tropes. """"No one works these days"""", """"All my taxes are going to people who don't want to work, I'm supporting these people"""", etc, etc. 

Finally he dropped the bomb. He said to her """"Maybe I shouldn't say this, and you're going to hate me for it, but... it's like we need another holocaust or something here!"""" 

I was stunned. And also stunned that she didn't push back at all, it was like he had told her he was going bowling this weekend. 

I knew I had to say something. I waited until their conversation ended and she departed and walked up to him. For context, I'm a male,  mid-30s, white presenting (though with Jewish heritage). I said """"Excuse me, sorry to interrupt."""" He turned to face me, at this point we were standing a foot or two from each other. I was looking right into his eyes. 

""""I couldn't help but overhear your joke about the holocaust. And I'm just curious, who are you thinking of killing?"""" 

I don't know what I was expecting-- shame, an apology, an honest answer? But he just walked away and said """"I don't have time for this shit!"""" (after blathering for about 20 minutes with this woman). I yelled after him """"I'm just asking you a question!""""

I'm glad I spoke up and said something, but I'm still rattled. The fact that this man felt comfortable enough saying something so egregious in a public space, within earshot of me, a total stranger, has been filling my head with visions of violence. And that this woman didn't shut him down after crossing that line made me really concerned. 

I live just over the line in VT, moved here earlier this year. The man is an unthinking coward, but masses of unthinking cowards are deadly. I'd like to think this was just one unhinged loon, but I'm not deaf to our political situation at the moment. It's strange feeling unsafe in my own home. I know not everyone has that privilege. But I'm wondering if any of us is safe at this point. To hear such disgusting, violent rhetoric so casually thrown around-- I've never heard anything like that. It's deeply unnerving. 

I feel paranoid and isolated all of a sudden-- and I'm thinking about buying weapons, make an escape plan, etc. Ironically, I'm sure this is the exact feeling this man lives with every day, and he's just activating it me. I don't want to descend to that level at all, but I also don't want to be willfully ignorant and dismissive about our situation here. I do feel like I need to take some sort of action-- maybe something more constructive, like setting up a mens group or something. Ugh. And really unsettlng.

NewHampshire,1f49ygf,Republican State Senator Dan Wolf Supporting Democrat Kamala Harris,"[Rep. Dan Wolf: I’m a Republican voting for Harris because truth and integrity matter](https://www.unionleader.com/opinion/op-eds/rep-dan-wolf-i-m-a-republican-voting-for-harris-because-truth-and-integrity-matter/article_aad7d0d8-62f3-11ef-9175-ef8239c06449.html)

AS A Granite Stater, a lifelong Republican, and a sitting member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, I deeply believe in American democracy.

I’ve served in the State House since 2016. I proudly represent New London and Newbury in Concord and I’m a current member of the Resources, Recreation, and Development Committee. I believe in truth, integrity, and standing up for the rule of law — and it’s clear to me that Donald Trump does not.

In 2020, Donald Trump lost the presidential election, plain and simple. And in America, when you lose, you dust yourself off, get back to work, and try again the next time.

But Trump can’t take a loss. Instead, he tried to overturn the election, echoing baseless lies and ignoring the rule of law in favor of his own set of rules.

That’s not how we do things here.

I look up to the presidency of the United States, and I want to vote for a candidate who I know will stand up for our Constitution and honor their oath to defend our democracy.

In January’s primary, I cast a vote for Nikki Haley because I know Donald Trump would destroy our democracy if reelected and I was not alone — 43% of voters in the Republican primary cast a vote against Donald Trump and his extremism.

Donald Trump said he doesn’t want the support of Haley voters like me, saying we’re “permanently barred” and “we don’t want them, and will not accept them.” Well, Kamala Harris has made clear there’s room for everyone in her campaign — including Republicans like me. And she’s earned my vote.

I’m a Republican, and I don’t agree with Kamala Harris on a number of policy issues. But I know she shares my deep love for our country and democracy. I respect her, I believe she has integrity, and I believe she has the fortitude to uphold the rule of law.

I can’t say the same for Donald Trump. And New Hampshire knows this too.

So to my fellow Republicans and independent voters in New Hampshire, I urge you to cast a vote on behalf of our democracy — a vote for Harris.

You don’t have to tell anyone, although you can. You don’t have to speak out, although you should. But when it comes time to vote in November, let’s do the right thing and stand up for our country and Constitution.",1724956661,1632,https://www.reddit.com/r/newhampshire/comments/1f49ygf/republican_state_senator_dan_wolf_supporting/,443,bubbynee,,,Health,198.9,384

NewHampshire,1d3nqur,Winter is over. PUT ON SOME FUCKING DEODORANT!,"I've been out and about this week running errands across the Concord/Pembroke/Suncook area and it seems that everywhere I go, I end up behind or passed by some nasty ass adult man whose body odor could peel the paint off my house. Just got back from the corner grocer and almost gagged while shopping because some guy in there smelled like he hasn't had a shower since groundhog day.

It's almost June, boys. Wash your ass and put some damn deodorant on your pits.

Edit for the pedantic: I wear deodorant year-round.

Edit 2: a lot of your motherfuckers reek of ass, eh? I wonder if I ran into any of you this week.

Edit 3: How are so many of you not embarrassed with yourselves? I can't believe I have to break this down, but apparently I do.

* There is an obvious difference between the kind of hot sweaty smell that happens to someone who has been working physically hard all afternoon and the kind of smell that comes from a body and clothing that have been accumulating oil, sweat, B.O., and more over multiple days or weeks. If you advanced past elementary school reading comprehension, you should be able to infer that I'm specifically referring to the latter, without me clarifying.
* Washing yourself and your clothing isn't just an expected societal norm, it's necessary for your health and well-being. Several people have come at me with the whole """"dEoDeRaNt iS a NeW iNvEnTiOn We DoN't nEED"""" and y'all can STFU. Deodorant has been available since the 1880's, it's not a new concept, and even if you don't want to wear it---bathing and wearing clean clothes have been a thing for a long, long time. Soap has existed for centuries.
* """"I don't have to wear it in the winter?!?!"""" You're trying to be funny but there are people out there that for genetic or other reasons, don't sweat much or if they do, they don't stink. There are people out there that don't need to wear deodorant. They still need to bathe themselves and wash their clothing!
* It's a stereotype that Redditors are gross, stinky, unwashed losers who live behind their keyboards. I have never seen it so blatantly displayed as in this thread. So many of y'all would rather defend a person who makes the experience of being out in public uncomfortable and even nauseating to those around them, not just me, but any other person they come in contact with. Fuck me, right? And fuck the cashiers that have to ring them out? And the bus driver who might be giving them a ride? And the healthcare workers they see? And all the other innocent people around them that have to deal with it? What is wrong with y'all?
   * One of you psychos went so far as to stalk some of my other threads to make off-topic comments about me needing deodorant. Why? What is wrong with you?
* Several of you have tried to come at me saying I'm entitled and ungrateful and all that shit. Not that it's any of your business but I've put in my time. I've worked with low-income, mentally unwell and unwashed folks for many years. I've worked multiple medical and manufacturing jobs that have had me on my feet for 10+ hours a day. I've probably smelled the B.O. from more unclean people in a decade than you have in your entire life. I'm allowed to be sick of it.

New Hampshire is a beautiful place and I love it here but holy fuck, I hope I never run into any of you. You're gross.

Oh and PS - Contrary to what you believe and likely practice, it's not gay to wash your ass.",1717019568,384,https://www.reddit.com/r/newhampshire/comments/1d3nqur/winter_is_over_put_on_some_fucking_deodorant/,217,SuckerForNoirRobots,,,Health,198.9,384

NewHampshire,1de9e43,“I see [town name] has gotten more DiVeRsE” …..,"…is what an older customer snidely said to the woman with her after making eye contact with me and scanning me up and down. She then said “I guess [town name] really is going downhill”. All of these loud enough for me to hear lllloooollllll

Tbh I’m just in a little shock rn because it caught me so off guard I have to laugh. I know this whole state is pretty much all white, especially in smaller towns (this one is ~23k ppl), but holy shit.

 I’m half white, half polynesian. I look pretty racially ambiguous but more white if that makes sense. I was mistaken for Hispanic a lot when i was younger. I still get “what are you?” every once in a while but like… i’ve never experienced indirect(?) racism(?????) like this. I’m not even that naturally dark like it’s SUMMER so I’m TAN just like every other white person in this state😭 Doesn’t help that I’m convinced half the people in this town are complete blockheads anyways. i don’t even know where to put this but god this interaction just makes me want to move out of this state even more. It makes me so sad for other poc in this state too. 

EDIT: okayy i didn’t realize so many people would see this but i do appreciate the kind words a lot! I think i just wanna clarify that i didn’t take this interaction super seriously. It was minor compared to experiences other POC have, and while it still wasn’t right, I was just taken aback in the moment. What she said isn’t a reflection on me, it’s on her. It hurt experiencing blatant ignorance, but what can I do about it? I know there’s racists everywhere, and that will take a longgg time to change.

 New Hampshire is still a beautiful state with a lot of wonderful people. I want to move because I don’t like living this rural, and if I lived in Manchester or a bigger city, maybe I would feel different. I hate how long it takes to get anywhere, I’m very isolated from online school and have no friends, I can’t even go out on a walk without walking on the side of a busy main road. This interaction is just like the cherry on top.

To everyone who thinks I would lie about such a small but upsetting experience, I’m glad you’ve lived such a life you don’t think this is believable.

NewHampshire,185jy5u,New guy in New Hampshire- my thoughts,"Good evening and a happy Monday evening to you all.

I moved up here from Dallas, Texas in August after living my whole life in the DFW suburbs. I’ll be honest, even though I’ve traveled a lot for work, I was incredibly apprehensive about leaving the same neighborhood I’ve lived in for the 25 years of my life. However, a hockey team up here gave me a job offer that I couldn’t pass up. So I held my nose and dived in.

It was a bit of an adjustment at first, but I can say with my whole heart that I love it here in New Hampshire. The natural beauty, the history of the region, the friendly folks, and the cold weather, it’s wonderful. Everyone I’ve met have treated me with kindness and respect. I genuinely love it here. And the job opportunities I’ve had are amazing.

I know this state gets a lot of guff from people. I just wanted to give my perspective. I love New Hampshire, and I’m happy to be here with y’all.

NewHampshire,1bdt22u,I’m embarrassed by our lack of focus on improving education in this state.,"Maybe I am just frustrated as a younger parent with small kids, but New Hampshire has a serious issue with a lack of focus on educational improvements because of our aging populations. 

Londonderry has been trying to pass full-day Kindergarten and improvements to our elementary school for 7+ years, but it keeps failing. Other towns are having similar issues. 

The tax cost is tiny - just a few dollars each year per household, but we can’t get it passed because  “taxes!!” 🙄

Our aging population here don’t want to help out the towns they live in. They got what they needed for their kids, and now their kids aren’t in school anymore, so they don’t care. It’s an embarrassment to our state. 

Personally, I can’t wait for a generational shift. Boomers are killing the country, and we have too many. Our nursing home state needs to get replaced with some fresh life that want to improve the communities and the education of our children. 

De-education of our children and a lack of focus on improvements to schools is exactly what our leaders want. They “love the poorly educated” and it sucks that we have so many in that crowd in this state.

NewJersey,1e6c6eh,"Coming from a transplant, your state does NOT deserve the hate that it gets ","I grew up in Vermont which, when compared to NJ, may as well be a different country. I moved here for work after school and I have just never understood why your state gets bashed so, so much. Are there flaws? Sure, but find me a state that has none, I’ll wait. 

Your reputation for being rude and snarky is very unfounded, in my experience. I have met some of the nicest people since moving here and people were always happy to hear that I chose to move here. Whereas so many other states would just pretentiously call you an obnoxious transplant while playing gatekeeping Olympics. 

People who say you guys are rude seem to always forget that there are fucking rude people anywhere you go, you guys just happen to be the most densely populated state; so you’re gonna find some dense populations of assholes but that is literally just society as a whole. With amazing people must come not so amazing people. Yin and Yang, if you will.

This state has a perfect blend of so many things someone could want. Near two major metropolitan cities with so much to offer, iconic and fun beach towns, a variety of cuisines (and some of the best I’ve had for that matter). People are efficient here and don’t take shit which I have huge admiration for, fuck da haters.

People here have even asked why I would ever move from Vermont to here and it just baffles be because they’re two completely different states and have amazing qualities in their own unique ways. Take it from a transplant, you guys are all right in my book 👌🏼

Viva la Jerz

Edit: it’s my duty to say this as a NJ resident. Read every single one of the comments saying how much it sucks here, it’s true. Please don’t come here. It’s spooky and scary and you’ll have a much cleaner and safer experience if you move to NYC. They’re right in describing NJ as Gotham.

I lost every house to a full cash offer and the only reason I got the house I have now is because the first 3 offers were asking too much from the sellers side.

NewJersey,1b1be50,Moved out... moving back,"From NNJ my entire life, hit 40 yrs old, said to myself  'fuck this, time to try a different state'... well after living in Maine the past 16 months, time to come back home.

I picked a town 15 min outside of Portland. Quiet, no traffic, nobody flipping the jersey state bird, and not one horn blown. Had no problem finding work. Food scene is actually dynamite, not the pizza or bagels though.

But the housing crisis is a thing up here just like jersey.  Old ass houses going for well over there intended value because all the Massholes came up and scooped up second homes for cash. Sounds pretty familiar (i.e. NY'rs coming to NJ).

But what really got me was the sense of humor up here. Or lack there-of. No sarcasm (jerseys second language), dry, vanilla/plain type people. Almost """"too"""" boring. Kind but not nice, is a thing up here. It was easier to make friend with transplants than it was actual locals.

The pay scale is not that great up here also. I'm in construction and it seems like they're about 10-15 yrs behind on the rest of the nation. Portland and surrounding towns are charging Hoboken prices to live here. So if you want to get a house under 400k, on at least an acre, you have to look almost an hr plus away from portland. Which puts you in the middle of trailer city. Property taxes aren't as much but pretty dam close.

Also the amount of racism is astounding.  2nd week up here some kkk group marched through Portland and noone did or said anything. Then the lewiston shooting. A shooting on 95 a couple months prior to lewiston. 

So my point is that.. the grass isnt always greener, only their weed is. I miss the diversity, my social life, distance to NYC/PHILLY/SHORE/MOUNTAINS. Now I'm on the road trying to get back into jersey, and I couldn't be happier.

I also used to love how cold our winters used to get. Our summers weren't as brutal 10 years ago, and our spring was very beautiful, it didn't get too hot. It never used to get too hot. But now...I think since 2023 September, it ALWAYS gets hot, and the December and November we had wasn't that cold, it was the weather we used to typically have in the fall. It doesn't know as much as it used to, I remember as a kid EVERY YEAR we would bare minimum, a foot of snow. Now, were lucky if we get 3 inches. It used to get cold from September to may, NOW it only gets cold for 4 months tops, and even so, not as much as it did in 2010/2011. It is currently the day of the fall equinox, and its still gonna be 80 this week. Its also gonna be in the high to mid 70s in the first week of October.

The land has subsided by as much as 11 inches since 2015 in a prime portion of the Permian Basin, as drillers extract huge amounts of oil and water, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of satellite data. In other areas where drillers dispose of wastewater in underground wells, the land has lifted by as much as 5 inches over the same period.

The constant extraction and injection of liquids has wrought complex geologic changes, which are raising concerns among local communities long supportive of oil and gas. Earthquakes linked to water disposal have rattled residents and prompted state regulators to step in. Some researchers worry that wastewater might end up contaminating scarce drinking-water supplies.

They don't want cannabis businesses near them, they don't want apartments or duplexes near them, they don't want retail near them, they don't even want new single family neighborhoods because they prefer the open spaces. They don't want any new development, they think they're the only ones that should be able to live here. If you don't want to live near new development then go to a rural area, this is a city. Please those of us that support more density, urbanism, and walkability, let's go speak at city council when they have hearings on this, the NIMBYs are very passionate and loud about it",1719281853,373,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewMexico/comments/1dnv2lx/i_hate_nimbys/,183,worried68,,,Education and Social Services,47,365

We all know that the Harris campaign has plenty of money. We are better off donating to candidates running for Congress and Senate, and this year, we've got a tight House race happening right here in our 2nd Congressional district. 

 Gabe Vasquez is running a very tight race to keep his seat and could use our donations, canvassing, and support. If you're able to help out in an way, please consider it.

NewYork,1bwo3ja,NYC officials ripped for sending earthquake emergency alerts nearly 25 minutes after the fact,"New York City officials were battered by critics Friday after a[ 4.8 magnitude quake](https://nypost.com/2024/04/05/us-news/earthquake-rocks-nyc-tri-state-area/) rocked the Big Apple — but it took nearly 25 minutes for an emergency alert to go out.

The quake struck near Lebanon, New Jersey, around 10:23 a.m. and was promptly felt across the tri-state area, according to the US Geological Survey.

But New York City didn’t issue an emergency Notify NYC phone alert about the tremor until 10:47 a.m.

It then also issued a WE Alert, or Wireless Emergency, message to phones at 11:02 .a.m., while the state’s WE Alert went out at 11:05 a.m. — and some residents reported still getting alerts about an earthquake after noon.

I trusted it as it came from an individual in a high position from a place that actually has hands in the support efforts for the hurricane. So I made a post here about the situation. 

Turns out this individual was talking from their ass using untrustworthy resources and not actual information from their leadership conducting support operations. 

I got a lot of hate here from the post and was confused, so I deleted the post. Then I looked more into it and found actual footage and photos that directly contradicted this person. So needless to say, I feel like an ass. 

I’m making it vague on purpose as I don’t want to draw attention to this piece of information, however I genuinely just wanted to apologize. Really with a national tragedy like the hurricane, a lot of media is purposefully using it to its advantage. Really for everyone not on the ground in the area, just be careful and verify what you find. Instead of trying to spread info, I now am focusing my efforts on just donating what I can to help.

NorthCarolina,1ejw60q,Roy Cooper,"Governor Cooper is currently on “The Weekend” show on MSNBC explaining his decision for declining the VP nomination.

I was not aware of the NC constitutional provision that states when the Governor leaves the state, the Lieutenant Governor becomes the Governor. He is concerned about leaving Robinson in charge of the state if he were to leave for the campaign. 

In this age of technology, why would we continue to enforce an archaic provision such as that? 

Thank you, Governor Cooper, you are truly a good man. I would have loved to see you as VP, and would still love to see you as Senator if you choose to run. But today I am very grateful for the way you stand by and protect your state.

NorthCarolina,1cjr5py,"Myrtle Beach Pastor Announces Wife's Death After Sermon, says suicide, but locals are finding evidence that suggest otherwise.","Lumberton is involved. 

Even though this case is new, there is SO much information coming out. I will try my best to keep things on topic and not confusing. I urge you to read until the end. It's going to end up being a huge case, there are a couple deaths involved, but we are here mostly and most recently for Mica Miller.

Victim: Mica Miller  
Husband: John Paul (JP) Miller  
Father of JP: Wayne Miller

When Mica was 14 years old, she lived in Myrtle Beach, SC and started attending youth group at Solid Rock Church. It was there that 28 year old year old JP started grooming her while he was married to his wife, who he shares 5 children with. His charges when he was married to her:

1. Knowingly damage property (2x)
2. Aggravated assault/deadly weapon
3. Possession of a liquor by minor (2x)
4. Possession of consumed liquor by a minor
5. Possession cannibis <2.5 grams (same night as the minors)
6. Contributing to the delinquency of a child
7. Domestic battery/bodily harm
8. Domestic battery/physical contact
9. Assault/assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature (2x)
10. Being on premises after warning or refuse to leave

The two got married when Mica was 23, and JP was 37. JP is the owner of the church Solid Rock, and from local reviews, ran off a lot of people. He had misogynistic views, would verbally attack people, and everyone feared for Mica. He verbally, financially, mentally, physically, spiritually, and sexually assaulted her throughout their marriage. If she wanted to leave, he would have her committed to the mental hospital. He openly talked about her struggles during his sermons, as did she. JP failed to mention HE was the reason for her mental struggles. He would emotionally torture her, make her watch him have sex with other women in front of her, slash her tires, stalk her, put tracking devices on her car, she was even sleeping couch to couch terrified of him finding and committing her again. From another friend, Mica escaped JP in February 2024. Friends were hiding Mica. She found out he was doing things with the money from the church and after that he put her in a mental hospital, again. When she got out, she told her friend, """"I am not mentally ill, I'm not sick, I don't want to harm myself, and he is going to make it look like I killed myself. He's going to try to frame me. One day I know he's going to do it."""" The church is not listed with the Southern Baptist Convention, nor it is listed as a non-profit. This could have been what Mica found out, he was committing tax fraud and had been for years. This last month, she started reconnecting with friends that JP had forced her to isolate from. One message from Mica to a friend on April 5 reads, :Thank.you for your gentle warnings throughout the years regarding my relationship with JP. I know that you knew I wasn't ready to get out but looking back your warnings were very helpful when trying to make tough life decisions. Definitely have replayed our convo's in my head over and over throughout the years and wished there was something I could do to get out. And now I've done it :)""""

To give you an example of what this guy is like when he preaches, In February 2024, here's part of a sermon he read aloud to his churchgoers: You know, a year ago, my wife, they went to Africa they had a wonderful trip and she came back with the idea to start a school in Africa. And 6 weeks ago she """"**goes to the hospital""""**, gets out, and just leaves me, completely leaves me, drains our bank accounts, and I go, """"Guess what? While you're talking bad about me out there I'm building a school in Africa for over 100 kids in order for them to be fed!"""" ...Goes on about God. then """"One day I'm gonna preach to God about getting rich, strong, healthy, and finding a hot wife that loves Jesus! That's what I'm gonna do."""" Then, he continues to bash Mica saying """"When my wife was in the hospital, um you know I looked at her phone, and I counted over the past 2 years, 18 people who had text her and said """"If you ever want to talk to someone about your husband, you can talk to me and say anything and I'll keep it confidential."""" This made him VISIBLY angry while on stage.

Mica filed for divorce and a protective order 48 hours before she was found dead.

The crime: In her final week she made plans to get her hair cut, get help with her car payment because she was a little short after paying the divorce lawyer, and planned on meeting her friends at a church service Sunday, April 28. On Saturday, April 27, Mica left in her work uniform to work at JPeters, a local restaurant. She never showed. Her body was discovered an hour and a half away, in Lumberton, NC. Her cause of death is a gun shot wound to the head. JP was not allowing her family to see her and was pushing for a quick cremation (that was denied and the family has seen her).  
Hours later, her husband, holds church service as normal Sunday, April 29. He has no remorse, emotion, and cracks jokes during his sermon. In the last 30 seconds of it, he says (and I'm paraphrasing but listening to it as I go) """"I have an announcement and I ask that after it you leave the church and do not talk about my announcement. I hope you continue to come to church and serve and give, you know, for the next little bit, I'm taking a little bit of a break, and I don't want to have to worry about the church. My break might be a few days, or a few weeks, I don't know. Uh I got a call late last night my wife has passed away and yeah it was self induced and it was up in North Carolina. And um we'll have a funeral for her next Sunday here at 3:00, and um yeah that's- I'm just, you know, going on adrenaline right now. Yall know she wasn't well mentally and uh she needed her medicine that was hard to get."""" (There is a video of this, despite JP deleting it from their church YouTube).  
3 days later her husband is seen and photographed at Coastal Grand Mall going into a sushi restaurant with his supposed girlfriend, Suzi. He is looking right into the camera.  
4 days later he is seen and photographed in a restaurant called Kingstreet Grille with the same supposed girlfriend, Suzi. She is looking at the camera with her eyebrows raised and her hand over her mouth.

On May 1, JP informed a news outlet he could not do their scheduled interview as he was leaving town for a few days. Today, May 3, the church has permanently closed.

SUZI SKINNER'S HUSBAND'S MYSTERIOUS DEATH (Girl from recent photos): it was common knowledge that JP and Suzi had been dating for a years. They h ave been sharing food and blankets at soccer games and they've been seen at the water park. in 2021, Suzi's then husband, who was paralyzed and lived his life in a wheelchair, drowned in a pool and it was """"suicide"""". Yes, you read that right.

WAYNE MILLER (AND ANOTHER MYSTERIOUS DEATH): (Living in Myrtle Beach as well) Arrested for hooking up with a minor in a shower, molestation charges, and then had the charges expunged. This was in the 90's.  
He forced J1 visa students who paid to trail to the US to attend his """"bible college"""", failure to pay them even minimum wage, failure to provide them with adequate shelter, food and more. He had federal charges from ICE for abusing the immigrant students while with him.  
He was exposed for lewd acts in Pakistan a few years back. He was living in a private society at the time called Eden Garden, which was full of younger boys. Remember, he has a history of molestation. Jerry Savelle, who started a church in Pakistan that Wayne was associated with, passed away on April 14, 2024 with no clear cause of death. In a video, you can see them talk about how Dr. Jerry Seville didn't know all the illegal things Wayne was doing and didn't realize he (Savelle) was contributing to.  
Also in Pakistan, he had a plan to make a false accusation in the Pakistan Court system because he was about to get exposed for his homosexual relationship and all the sexual abuse he was committing there. The allegations (we don't know what they were) were proven to be false by Pakistan Court this past October. He then had his male lover come to America with his Pakistan sister, and Troy (Wayne's friend) was the """"sponsor"""" to marry the sister so they could come here. An article about Troy from 2003 reads, """"A former Myrtle Beach area pastor is facing charges of child molestation. 32-year old Robert Troy Taylor turned himself in to Georgetown County Authorities Saturday. He's the former pastor at the Low Country Community Church in Murrell's Inlet, just south of Myrtle Beach. The charges are reportedly connected to two incidents with 12- year old boys from more than a decade ago."""" The company you keep.....

JP's OLDER SON: He has a history of domestic abuse against his wife and served time for hitting her over the head with a glass bottle in January 2024.

Search the hashtag JusticeForMica on Facebook and you can see videos, pictures, text messages, etc. Please ignore the obituary this abuser wrote, it is so disgusting. Paints himself in an amazing light. This is only the beginning. Her death was called a suicide, but Robeson County is investigating it and ALL of this information has been sent to our local police department as well as Robeson County. A protest is being held on the public property outside of the church and walk around a few blocks on Sunday at 9:00 am, even though the news came out today they are closed. This is for Mica. One of her last videos she uploaded to her Facebook was her speaking out about her abuse, and she looks so empty inside.

Sorry if this was confusing, but police have barely released any information except the basics. But the rest were from old articles and people's stories about her. I tried to piece it all together the best I could to show this entire family is about to go down, as they should have a long time ago.


Edited to add: JP Miller announced the cause of death before police did. As if any more suspicion from him was needed..",1714794276,898,https://www.reddit.com/r/NorthCarolina/comments/1cjr5py/myrtle_beach_pastor_announces_wifes_death_after/,305,deleted,,,Health,228.3,823.2

NorthCarolina,1g6j11h,I’m fucking outraged.,"(UPDATE): Thank you to everybody who provided helpful ways to remedy the situation! I was unaware of the fact that I could go to my BOE and get an ID specifically for voting; I’m going to try and head there today. I didn’t research because I didn’t have to before, so I wasn’t worried about it. If anybody else runs into a situation like me, I hope this post is helpful and people can find the links in the comments to help them out! Also, just because this is my first post on Reddit does not mean it is fake, lol. Lurkers are a thing. Have a great day everyone, and make sure you vote early so you deal with these problems here and now!!!


This is EXACTLY why I voted no on the strict photo ID law in N.C. I am an American citizen, born on American soil, and have lived in North Carolina my ENTIRE LIFE. I grew up here, went to college in this state, and now I WORK for the state as a teacher, of all the service jobs I could have chosen. A little while ago, my wallet was stolen. My one and only photo ID was in that wallet. I have no passport, because I have never even TRAVELED outside of the country. Today, I went to cast my vote, at the school THAT I WORK AT, and was told that a photo of my actual ID was not enough. I explained the situation, and that I had ordered a duplicate but it was not yet here, and was told there was no possible way that I could vote that day unless it got delivered before the polls close. THIS IS WHY VOTER ID LAWS DO NOT WORK. All they do is prevent ACTUAL CITIZENS from voting. It is yet another tactic the Republican Party has used to REMOVE RIGHTS. As long as I am an American citizen, I should be able to vote in so called “free and fair elections.” Today I was told that my ability to vote was not free, and would cost me the $25 it costs to get a new photo ID. If you can’t see how fucking insane that is, go live somewhere where they don’t have democracy, so that people who actually believe in it can use it.",1729260766,1600,https://www.reddit.com/r/NorthCarolina/comments/1g6j11h/im_fucking_outraged/,748,PurpleRain4242,,,Health,228.3,823.2

NorthCarolina,1fzxph8,PSA: You Should know about the Constitutional Amendment that will be on your ballot.,"
(Reposted to fix a typo)

When you go to vote. You will see an Amendment that says:

>Constitutional amendment to provide that only a citizen of the United States who is 18 years of age and otherwise possessing the qualifications for voting shall be entitled to vote at any election in this State.

With an option to vote for or against. 

Seems silly, right? It’s already illegal for noncitizens to vote. Here’s the real detail behind this amendment:

Currently in NC, eligible voters are “every person born in the United States *and every other person who has been naturalized,* 18 years of age”

What a vote *for* this amendment does is remove the “every other person who has been naturalized” language. 

Read more about it [here](https://www.wunc.org/politics/2024-10-07/2024-north-carolina-ballot-citizens-only-voting-amendment)

Edit: as u/MisterProfGuy pointed out, the other important piece of this amendment is the language “*and otherwise possessing the qualifications for voting.*” This language leaves the door open for lawmakers to add additional qualifications or disqualifications (such as being an ex-felon, for example) to voting.

NorthCarolina,1gexljh,Just had a conversation with my friend of 20+ years and what he said to me had me stunned….,"So I was very excited to send my sticker in the group chat to the boys, and the response I got when I told I voted Harris had me floored. Found out one of the boys is voting for Trump/Mark Robertson. The reason was apparently FEMA is refusing to help NC because of a lithium deposit, and a weather machine was used to destroy everything so the government could take the land from them to get the to the lithium?   How far down does one have to travel to get this kind of info?? Starting to realize he is FUBAR and at this point cannot be swayed differently. Now I’m starting to question our friendship because of his world view….

EDIT: so this blew up way more than I expected lol. So as I’m reading through as many comments as I can, I’d like to say that I’m happy to know that I’m not the only one that is coming to terms with people in our lives about this. This isn’t just a simple traditional Republican vs. Democrats election cycle. We can have friends with different political views. However this is really starting to get out of hand with this MAGA movement. I will most likely be going no contact at this point with the friend in question, but 20 years is 20 years, so I’m sad about what is transpiring in real time…

Also to be clear, I’m registered as UNA(independent) as I believe neither side is perfect. Though I am left leaning, this election cycle feels like it’s never been more important to vote in our country’s history. My view is that woman’s rights is just the start of what could be taken away from humans in general. It’s almost Handmaids Tale in real life…While most upper middle White men will probably make it through unscathed regardless of who is our next leader. I’m looking as far ahead as I can at the possibility of what else could be taken from minorities. I can’t believe the race between a Felon and a prosecutor could be THIS close…we are in such a worst state then even I could’ve fathomed ",1730216324,1211,https://www.reddit.com/r/NorthCarolina/comments/1gexljh/just_had_a_conversation_with_my_friend_of_20/,639,Stretch407,,,Health,228.3,823.2

That is why it is especially important for you to familiarize yourself with the harsh realities of the document, particularly the demolishment of the social safety net.

Under a Trump administration Social Security, Medicare, and most important to you, Medicaid budgets will be slashed. Unemployment insurance will be all but discontinued, overtime pay virtually eliminated, Equal opportunities will no longer exist, and guaranteed job security a thing of the past because Unions will be driven from the workplace.

When you combine all that with a nationwide ban on abortion, government oversight of women's periods to assure they bring every baby to term regardless of viability, and imprisonment for crossing borders to get healthcare -- not to mention making contraception illegal -- the future of the underclass looks bleak.

For your own self-interest and the future of your families, familiarize yourself with Project 2025 before it's too late.

Some other facts:

Project 2025 will """".eliminate food stamps for people who do not have a job or are not looking for a job. This means that people who are out of work and do not have enough money to buy food will not be able to get help from the government. \[299\]

...make it harder for people to get affordable housing. This means that people who are struggling to afford a place to live will have fewer options and may end up homeless. \[503\]

...make it harder for people to get affordable health care. This means that people who are struggling to afford health care will have fewer options and may not be able to get the care they need. See Healthcare, Medicaid, Medicare

...make it harder for people to get a good education.

NorthDakota,1f0x46g,"Measure 2, Pissing on the will of the voters 3.0","Measure 2. 

It's the latest attempt by the Legislature to sabotage the ballot initiative process and piss on the will of the voters. It's their 3rd attempt after 2 failed atrempts. Nobody asked for this. They must be getting angry because the voters approved ideas they don't like, like term limits and age limits. They certainly don't like seeing things on the ballot like marijuana legalization or ending property taxes

Constitutional Measure 2 

The short version is they want the voters to approve it TWICE, at the primary and the general election. They want to increase the number of required signatures by nearly 8,000. They want to change who can collect signatures. They want to fuck with the fiscal note to influence voters AND add the single subject rule. The single subject was used in South Dakota to kill the marijuana legalization measure they passed in 2020.

This makes ballot measures extremely hard to get on the ballot.  To qualify for the primary,  it pushes the timeline back to get on the June primary. And since they want to increase the number of required signatures and ban out of state collectors, we won't see any future ballot measures. They can influence the election by fucking with the fiscal note. But if the voters still pass a measure, they can invalidate the results by claiming it wasn't a single subject,  like they did on South Dakota for marijuana legalization 

This is an awful ballot measure.  Not sure why anyone would vote to amend the constitution to take away their rights. They must be hoping turnout is low and people won't do their homework

NorthDakota,1fdfihy,"July 1st, all Delta THC products were made illegal in North Dakota ","Short version. The Federal Hemp Bill legalized THC, as long as it's derived from hemp and less than 3% THC. So retailers started extracting THC from Hemp and selling various Delta products. These are now illegal.

So if you want pure weed, you better vote November 5th for Measure 5

Ag Commissioner Doug Goehring said “We are going to make sure that psychotropic substances, or any altered product, is not available for retail sales in North Dakota,”

Ohio,188ew5t,"A week ago, republicans were commenting on every post that there was nothing wrong with editing the marijuana bill that passed with """"common sense"""" changes.","Just wondering if we are now all ready to admit that giving an inch to these ghouls will get the entire bill we voted on thrown in the trash. Every single day now a new idea is presented to continue making marijuana illegal throughout counties in Ohio because it was NEVER about """"common sense"""" legislation, and it has always been about subverting the will of the people when corrupt Republicans in office do not get their way. 

I am seeing less defense of these new bills in the comments, probably because they are blatantly indefensible. Anyone who voted for these people should be ashamed, and I can only dream that conservatives throughout the state will finally get it through their heads that they are supporting people who would sooner destroy democracy than let them enjoy even a smidge of personal freedom.

Ohio,1g0iasf,Political hate speech making Ohio less safe,"I hate election season. We are constantly inundated with political ads from people who don't care about us. The worst part of it, for me at least, is the Republican hate speech. I can't use YouTube anymore because every 2 minutes I get a new ad calling immigrants """"illegals"""" and calling trans women """"biological men"""". I get like 3 flyers a week in the mail talking about how trans people are predators or how we make children unsafe by existing. I hate how I can't leave the house anymore without getting death glares from people who are eating the propaganda up. I was pushing a friend's kid on the swing this week, and a parent rushed over and took his daughter off the swing next to the one we were using, and he gave me a super aggressive stare... for pushing a child on a swing next to his kid. I know lots of immigrants are facing discrimination as well.

I guess it just makes me sad that one party is allowed to blast literal hate speech into our homes and there's nothing I can do about the fact that it's making society less safe for trans people and for immigrants (or, let's be real, BIPOC period). Even people who are ostensibly on my side are now using the derogatory language right-wingers use. I keep seeing liberals refer to trans women as """"biological men"""", to immigrants as """"illegals"""", and cracking """"ironic"""" jokes about eating pets. Even if the Republicans don't win their elections, they've still won the overall goal of poisoning society against certain populations. It all feels so hopeless when it seems like roughly half of Americans are okay this. I fear for the day when I will be randomly assaulted by a right-winger who watches too much Fox News. I look forward to election season being over, but I know that the propaganda will stick with many people, and I will be dealing with its effects on people for the rest of my life. I genuinely don't know how to exist in a society where half the people think it's okay to fearmonger against The Other, and it doesn't make them question their conscience or morals or belief systems.",1728565384,2787,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ohio/comments/1g0iasf/political_hate_speech_making_ohio_less_safe/,1177,resistingvoid,,,Health,478,2366.3

Ohio,1ggf7g3,Proud to be a republican and If I early voted so should you.,"(I said one more day for early voting , i was wrong thank you /u/SugarbearSID 

Early in person voting goes until Sunday the 3rd.

https://www.ohiosos.gov/elections/voters/current-voting-schedule/2024-schedule/
)

&nbsp;



GO VOTE, bring a friend.    I Voted today.    I didn't vote for president in any election until 2020.  I wanted trump to win in 2016 though.    My family and children have various health issues including someone with terminal lung damage.    My spouse is an analyst in healthcare.   When covid hit, it was crazy.  Our life stopped.   We saw maybe 5 masks in 3 years of covid.   Because our children wore masks they were no longer invited to birthday parties, they no longer had friends , our family disowned us and went no contact (after taking us to court because of their belief covid injection = child abuse ) .    

&nbsp;




After all that, and watching my spouse watch ever press release, every new study document, about the spread and science, watching President Trump lie, belittle, and demean the voters by misrepresenting his data / graphs and what various statistics meant I finally decided to vote for the first time, but against my own political party.     



&nbsp;




That's what made me vote in 2020.      


&nbsp;





Turns out my vote mattered in 2020 (as did my few like minded friends.)  I lived in maricopa county AZ.     When they went to certify the election results on jan 6.  We watched live reading to celebrate when AZ was certified.    AZ's certification is what set off the objections and began what we know as january 6th now.



&nbsp;







We left AZ behind us, came to ohio.   I voted today because my spouse believes that Ohio is probably going to go blue this year.   There are a lot of similarities the last 2 years in ohio, that there was in the last 2 years of living in AZ before that election.   





&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;




Screw your political party,   put all your issues, reservations, policy things in the backseat where they belong.   This year we vote to be heard.   If you want to make sure Ohio goes blue.  GO VOTE, BRING A FRIEND.    If you want to make sure it stays red, you better get your ass out and vote because we sure did, and you better bring friends to vote too, because we sure did.   

No matter who you vote for, go vote.  


&nbsp;




**MAKE**





**AMERICA**





**SANE**





**AGAIN.**




&nbsp;




Who ever wins, wins.    Assholes, dipshits, and criminals have been president before,  let's not let them change who WE ARE.


Thank you for attending my ted talk.



&nbsp;
PS.   My beliefs in how help should get to the people in need align more to the traditional beliefs of the conservitive mentality.  That people should be helped and impacted most by the government around them, and that the federal gov should do the big things like covid responses, providing for the welfare of people, making laws to guide the states, oh and i personally believe the fed should make abortion legal. 

Edit:   Arrived at early voting in Summit County: at 7:29 (opens at 7:30)  Left at 8:14.   Read the entire ballet to a young child and explained each issue and why I was voting the way I was on each issue.

edit 2: people made a good point that Brown for senate is just as important, I typed this off the cuff while eating breakfast, figured I'd get my usual 2 comments, 9 upvotes.  YES ON 1

[edit]  I have got suicide watched, told to drop dead, called a nazi a bunch of times, and called just evil.     I'm just going to assume those are just bots or misguided people who don't know how to deal with the anxiety and stress they have in life and are using vitrol filled opinions as an outlet.  I hope they find the help they deserve and need if that's the case.



&nbsp;


[at the time of writing this we have 1394 comments,  i have read every one and responded to most of the ones that addressed me.   the last 30 minutes there has been a HUGE uptick in thinly veiled advertisments supporting one of the two parties, i find that manipulative and the opposite of what the point of this post was.   I've had great conversations with people who disagree with me on almost every political point today, made friends from across the isle who started out by saying reactionary or rude things.    


 These new posters coming in now, they are here to cause us to blame each other, to turn it into a compitition , it isn't.   Vote for who ever you want,  That's democracy I don't want to be a part of a democracy where we don't count every vote. if I could push a button and every american citizen could safely and securely vote from their home , i would.   each voice should be heard.    Once the names are on the ballet, am proud of everyone who votes no matter who they voted for.  That's their choice, that's their voice, and shame on anyone shaming each other for who they voted for. Once someone casting a ballot is like getting an abortion, you should be able to make your own choices , based on your own reasoning, with out someone after the fact trying to make you feel bad for exercising a right.     


  I'm going to stop responding so much now because of the obvious trolls trying to incite people.

Ohio,1e91x07,Governor DeWine responds to President Biden’s announcement and gets slammed for his graciousness.,"Apparently there is a large share of the Ohio population that is not happy that our governor took the high road. The name calling in the comments is mind blowing   He was called a RINO, a Democrat,  a RINO traitor, apathetic governor, worst Ohio governor ever.

While there were a number of comments praising Governor DeWine for keeping it classy, there were also gems like:

You just need to resign as well. 
Seriously?
Figures. 
You should have lost in the midterm primary. 
Resign. 
Why don’t you leave so we can replace you with a Republican?
So you have known for decades about Joe and his corruption. 
Sell out. 
You suck. 
I hope you don’t have a voice in JD’s replacement. 
Of course you do, you’re as corrupt as he is. 
You’re a loser. 
RINO. You make me want to puke. 
Did you sniff children with him?

WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE??? Are these our neighbors?  Our fellow Ohioans?  I realize I live in a fairly blue bubble (Cuyahoga County) and that most of the state is far more conservative…but the level of mean spiritedness from what are assumedly Republicans towards one of their own because he took the high road and was gracious and kind towards a member of the other party is just ugly.

Oklahoma,19duip7,Dem Running in a Red State,"Hi everyone, and happy national Run For Office Day!

&#x200B;

My name is Kody Macaulay and I am running for Congress in District 4. I'm a disabled veteran, former law enforcement officer, current IT nerd, and best of all, a dad. I'm just a normal guy that misses public service, loves bitching about politics, and decided to do something about it. I want to show my little girls that it's ok to stand up and try and be the change you want to see in the world. Assuming I make it through the primary, I will be going up against Republican incumbent Tom Cole, a man who has been in politics since before I was born.

&#x200B;

Tom Cole has been in that seat for 20+ years and I believe it's time for a change. Tom nominated Jim Jordan for Speaker of the House, and in his speech he admitted to wanting to cut social security and medicare, programs that 20% of Oklahomans rely on to get by. He's vocally against abortion rights and LGBTQ rights and continues to spew false narratives coming from the right.

&#x200B;

Enough is enough.

&#x200B;

Abortion ***is*** healthcare, and it's time for us to put that into law. Trans rights ***are*** human rights, and the LGBTQ+ community should be able to live a life free from harassment and have the same rights as everybody else. Social Security ***is*** salvageable by lifting the tax cap on the rich. ***TAX THE RICH*** because corporate greed is killing us.

&#x200B;

My website is [www.kodyforok.com](https://www.kodyforok.com) and I'd love for you to learn more about me as I try and tackle this seemingly impossible task of flipping a district in Oklahoma. Remember, only 30% of registered Oklahoman's voted in the last election. We don't know if Oklahoma is really a red state, it's just uncontested.

&#x200B;

Feel free to AMA and I'll try and get to all of them. Also the donation button is on the website if you are so inclined to help me out by making a contribution. As always, FEC filings are public record and I urge you to review what all of your elected officials are spending their money on and where their money is coming from.

&#x200B;

Edit: [https://www.fec.gov/data/](https://www.fec.gov/data/)  Here's the FEC link where you can look up anyone running for federal office. Keep us all accountable!

&#x200B;

Edit 2: District 4 encompasses the following large(ish) cities...

Tinker/Midwest City/Del City

Moore

Norman

Chikasha/Blanchard

Lawton/Ft Sill

Duncan

Ardmore

Ada

Oklahoma,1ci3f0x,Visitors in Sulphur (rant) sorry,"I hate to be the negative Nancy, but this bothered me. The governor’s visit to Sulphur was nothing further than ceremonial. Whatever. The thing that bothered me was that he was accompanied by Ryan Walters. RYAN WALTERS does NOT care about Sulphur. In fact, he hates every Oklahoman that he saw the day he visited. 
Sulphur is a small community that doesn’t require or ask for much, but remains sufficient with the help of state taxes just like any other rural town. It’s not Moore or Norman. It’s not Tulsa or even Lawton. Sulphur is not a destination. It’s grassroots. 
Ryan Walters went to Sulphur and pretended that he cares about a place like Sulphur. Ryan Walters’ goal is to destroy the public school system. There is now a Veritas school in Sulphur that is part of that plan. It’s a plan to create a Christian Nationalistic future. It’s an avenue for wealthier families to get a tax break if they choose Veritas that is created in order to mold children to be the future Christian Nationalist leaders in their weird dream world where groups are easier to marginalize. It’s dystopian. 
I love Oklahoma, but I left because of these people. They DO NOT care about you. They don’t want to help. Ryan Walters and Stitt probably couldn’t wait to bathe when they got back to OKC just from shaking hands with the residents of Sulphur. It’s sad that Oklahoma is only second to Tennessee in regressive legislation and attitude toward humanity and that is proven time and time again by ballot. 
I hope that it can turn around. It’s embarrassing and trust me when I say that people all over the country roll their eyes at Oklahoma’s politics. 
Ryan Walters is just as weird as Stitt. Awful. I wish for the best, but it’s never showed any chance of getting better. ",1714613655,484,https://www.reddit.com/r/oklahoma/comments/1ci3f0x/visitors_in_sulphur_rant_sorry/,111,Dinglederple,,,Health,111,365.2

Oregon,1druj0o,To whoever stole our tent,"To the a\*\*holes who stole our tent on Monday while we were dispersed camping in mt hood national forest, yall are truly evil. 

PSA: careful leaving your stuff while dispersed camping out in mt hood national forest. We had read about theft at trailheads & were already paranoid but wasnt expecting this… 

My husband and I finally got the chance to go camping since having our kid and this was going to be our first night. There was no one else on the forest road when we drove down it initially and there were already made fire rings. We chose the end of the road to be more secluded and it gave us a view of mt hood from our tent. (We chose dispersed camping over an actual campground cause our kid still cries loudly multiple times at night and we didn’t want to wake everyone up). We set up camp while our baby was napping in the car and decided to head somewhere for a short excursion since it was only 4pm. We literally were gone only two hours on a short one mile hike just a 5 minute drive down the highway after setting up our tent. We were reminiscing about how great it feels to get back out in nature & go camping the whole time. 

We decided to head back early since it was 6pm so our 14 month old boy could play at the campsite. I cannot describe the feeling of having my heart just drop into my stomach when we came back to see our campsite wiped clean except for the travel crib sitting out in the dirt. We had only set up our tent (our beloved north face wanona); inside was our thermarest pads, tarp, shovel, & even a new mosquito screen tent I never got the chance to set up. We got to the campsite furious & sad, with baby fussy as his bedtime was creeping up and he was tired from being in the car seat. Since they took our place to stay that night, we had to make the 6 hour drive back home immediately. (We didn’t want to find a hotel and have to take everything out of the car into the hotel so our car wouldn’t get broken into either. )

I am still fuming to this day indisbelief of how this happened, our kid never got to even see the tent since he never left the car seat. I guess I’m just here to vent as I still can’t get over how this happened so quick... But I guess I have to be thankful they left us his travel crib???? I at least had snapped a few last pics of our tent and camp spot

Oregon,1fjluu1,National Forest system will have no seasonal employees in 2025,"This seems like a good place to spread the news that the USFS will not be hiring seasonal employees next summer, meaning there will be essentially no one on duty to patrol for things like untended fire, clean up vandalism and visitor sites, or really do anything on the forests at all. This news came from an internal letter sent out by all USFS regions, nationwide (I have yet to find any external sources writing articles). 

Yes, there will still be fire fighters (though they're all quitting anyway), and there will still be a handful of permanent employees, but this will take out the majority of non fire fighting roles, leaving maintenance, recreation, wildlife, botanical, forestry, education and general forest care roles unfilled. 

I moved out west because I care very deeply about the forests, and if people aren't aware of what's happening, summer 2025 could be extremely devastating - remember how much damage was done when the government shut down! Because of this, we are now doubly responsible for the actions we take on what few unburned, non logged forests remain.

The beauty of the state speaks for itself, and the fact that Oregon beaches are owned by the people makes it so, so much better. There's nothing else like it. 

Oregonians (is that right?) were friendly, patient (go drive in Texas if you don't believe me), and very helpful. Maybe it's the weather and being surrounded by natural beauty. 

I can't wait to go back, and maybe even move to Oregon permanently some day. Whatever problems the state may be having, I hope you all get through them.

Trump and his surrogates are panicking about the election as turnout in Pennsylvania shows women have been outvoting Men by a higher margin than expected.

This is incredibly good for democrats since the election is now divided through a gender-gap instead of the usual lines of urban/rural and race demographics. It is very likely Kamala performs better amongst all women than she does with latinos.

In the latest[ USA TODAY/Suffolk University national poll,](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/21/harris-trump-tied-battle-latino-black-voters/75682566007/) women decisively backed Democrat Kamala Harris, 53% to 36%. That’s a mirror image of men’s overwhelming support for Republican Donald Trump, 53% to 37%. If those margins hold until Election Day, it would be the biggest disparity since a gender gap emerged more than four decades ago, in 1980.

https://preview.redd.it/l52se7af43yd1.png?width=1290&format=png&auto=webp&s=7633c73d8b3bee251c7c0b6fb362755d5c04956a

This is why Trump is already throwing doubts into the election. He banked on low-propensity voters and the fact men have become extremely right-wing. This seems to be backfiring as they are not turning out.

[Dems see signs for optimism in gender gap in early vote](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/29/gender-gap-early-voting-00186155)

Since Joe Biden dropped out, 30% of all newly registered voters in Pennsylvania are 18-29 year old women. It sounds like women may be the ones to save this country, and their rights.

""""looking at the racial breakdown of women early voters in PA, we see the biggest increases among women of color, especially Black women whose turnout is 248% of their turnout at this point in 2020, compared to 146% for white women."""" [analysis](https://x.com/tbonier/status/1844719900591337662)

So it's not just the fact that women in general are turning out higher, but they're also younger, more racialized, more urban, more educated, but even amongst new older white women, they are more democratic than average. It's an insane showing for Democrats. Explains why suburban-heavy states like Kansas that used to vote Republican have shifted to the left by HUGE margins.

If Dobbs-backlash stopped the 2022 red-wave, we may see an absolute blue tsunami this year.

Too bad young men have been brainwashed by Andrew Tate and other twitch streamers. Twitch has literally caused devastating harm to social cohesion.

  
Note : While I do think Kamala will win PA, she is not guaranteed to win the election as Nevada, Georgia, and Wisconsins are razor-thin close and numbers are meh for both sides.",1730377874,4209,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pennsylvania/comments/1ggdcld/why_are_women_outvoting_men_by_a_huge_margin_in/,1006,iLoveKirikosToe,,,Health,377.3,1288.6

Pennsylvania,1emeozc,"Shapiro, Harris, and Walz hit a home run in Philly last night","The Harris/Walz rally in Philadelphia last night was one of the most inspiring things I’ve ever seen.  In an election season that for so long just seemed like a choice between the lesser of the evils, there is finally something good worth voting for. 

Governor Shapiro gave a fantastic speech in which he thoroughly endorsed Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, and said he will do everything he can to get them elected. 

Then Kamala Harris gave an impassioned speech in which she extolled the virtues of her new running mate—his military service, his career as a high school teacher and football coach, his public service as a congressman and governor.

She also spoke of the things they want to do to make this country better—affordable housing, affordable health care, building an economy where everyone has the chance to own a home, start a business, and build wealth, defending the freedom to vote, to be free from gun violence, to love who you love openly and with pride, to make your own reproductive choices.

The final speaker was Tim Walz.  In a down-to-earth way, relatable to so many Americans, he explained why Trump and Vance are bad for the country.  This is a man who, from his background, has a lot in common with the average MAGA supporter.  Yet here he was condemning Trump’s criminality and the push by Republicans to take away basic freedoms.

Freedom is really what this election is about.  We are in a dangerous era where people are actually praising the idea of presidential immunity, and trying to take away freedoms of those they disagree with.  It’s good to know we still have candidates who remember what America is supposed to be about.

Pennsylvania,1gghdx3,Rural PA: You have more Democratic neighbors than you think,"I spent last weekend canvassing near Lancaster (and will again this weekend), and I noticed something interesting.  As a canvasser, I had a list of registered Democrats and independents to try to speak with.  

This was about 20 minutes outside of Lancaster, in a pretty rural area.  On two occasions, the Democratic voter I spoke with wished me luck but warned me, """"We're one of the few,"""" or """"You won't find a lot of Democrats around here.""""  In fact, I was knocking on about every fourth house -- and these were just the voters we weren't sure were voting blue.

At the end of my canvas, I got an Uber back to Lancaster.  The car stopped in the wrong driveway, and when I got there, the 40-something white male homeowner was standing on his lawn.  I apologized and said I was getting a ride after canvassing.  He asked me who I was backing.  When I told him, he nodded and said, """"You've got two votes here.""""

Over the past 11 or so years, I've made a hobby of exploring every part of the state I can run safely on a road.  Also, some parts that aren't roads.  A few parts that weren't terribly safe either.



I've used CityStrides as a tool to track and layer all these runs.  My detailed map can be found [here](https://citystrides.com/users/5240/map).  Now, I want to know if I missed a spot (that I'd have permission to go).  Need recommendations for trails as well!



Alternatively, ask a guy dumb enough to spend years running down dead end roads anything you want to know.  Cheers!

Quick edit: there's a ton of both hilarious and helpful responses, suggestions, and questions that I didn't anticipate, y'all are amazing and thank you. I have a great to-do list that I can keep adding to! Will try to get to more stuff after work tonight, appreciate this so much.",1722817827,499,https://www.reddit.com/r/RhodeIsland/comments/1ekafag/hi_neighbor_i_ran_past_your_mailbox/,207,ChefAaronFitz,,,Transportation and Infrastructure,82,218

This is not a political sub but just a friendly reminder for anyone thinking to vote for Trump this year - his Project 2025 plans on disbanding NOAA:

It proposes abandoning strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions responsible for climate change, including by repealing regulations that curb emissions, downsizing the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and abolishing the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which the project calls """"one of the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry.""""

RhodeIsland,1d8pxbw,Right on red,"I know that """"RI drivers suck"""" posts are ubiquitous and that RIers probably aren't that much worse than everyone else. 

But, hey, maybe one of you goobers who doesn't understand Right on Reds and how they are supposed to work will read this and think for a second next time and make life a little better for RIers. 

Here are some simple guidelines:

- Right on red is voluntary not mandatory. If someone in front of you isn't taking it, they may have a reason. Take your fucking horn and shove it all the way up your ass. In fact, get all of your family members, have them grab their horns, and shove all of them all the way up your ass.

- Right on red is the literal last priority at an intersection that is allowed to go. This means your fucking right on red is not more important than pedestrians, cross traffic, someone taking a left with a left arrow, again pedestrians, did I fucking mention pedestrians you fucking pieces of shit?

- The stop line at an intersection still applies if you have a right on red. That means a right on red isn't an invitation to nose half your fucking car into the intersection and also block the crosswalk at the expense of cross traffic including cyclists and OH YEAH FUCKING PEDESTRIANS YOU FUCKING IMBECILES.

- Right on red requires you to STOP, then check the the road is clear (including bikes and yes once mother fucking again, pedestrians) and then proceed. It's not a """"fuck yeah I have a right on red I can plow forward with no abandon I am the coolest dude on the planet.""""

In my Providence life I have been hit on my bike 3 times and twice as a pedestrian. I have also had about 5 close calls as a pedestrian (like where I had to take evasive action or rap on somebody's car with my cane to let them know I was in the crosswalk). All but one were right on red fucking idiots, including yesterday. I am being profane to be funny but I think maybe traffic engineers should stop using right on red as a crutch for their shitty throughput goals.

The guy followed me to the next exit, pulled up in the lane next to me. This guy actually puts his car in reverse to get in line with my car. He starts screaming at me. I try to ignore it. He starts moving his car towards mine to hit it, and I relent. I open my window. 

He's screaming about how he's licensed to carry and I better watch out. I just say okay, man, sounds good. That pisses him off more. He's saying how he'll follow me home and kill me. I start calling 911. The light changes and he speeds off.

911 is useless; they say unless he's still at the intersection, they can't do anything. I gave them his license plate and they said, """"Okay, but there is no way to prove he was the one making threats.""""

Winner is Dave's, no contest. So much more coffee flavor than the other two and just the right amount of sweetness. Surprisingly also the thickest syrup. The color was a little brighter too. And the syrup was also the best when tasting by itself, would be great as a topping on ice cream. 

Autocrat is the old standard but tasting side by side with the others it was a little too sweet. Slimo was the thinnest syrup by far of the three and was somewhat bland at the ratio used. When I added another tablespoon it was much better, very similar to autocrat but less sweet.

Both Dave's and Silmo are made from cane sugar, autocrat is made with high fructose corn syrup. All were around the same price, Dave's $9.99, silmos $8.99 and Autocrat $7.49, but autocrat was double the size, 32oz vs 16oz of the other two.

RhodeIsland,1g47mtb,Illinois resident here.   Rhode Island is the greatest state.,"Sorry to be a tourist...  
  
Grew up in upstate New York and the Chicago suburbs. Spent part of my youth metro Detroit, Michigan.  Sister went to school in RI.  Recently went back to RI with her and after visiting 42 of the 50 states, I have to call RI my favorite.  

1.  Food is excellent everywhere.  Too many good restaurants to name.   Coffee is superior to anything I've had in any major metro hub.  Providence being a culinary hotbed certainly has something to do with it.  
  
2.  RI in the fall is the best.   Taking Route 6 west into the smaller cities was the most relaxed I've felt in years.  Epic views.  
  
3.  I love that in one single day I can make day trips to the beach and the bigger cities and not feel taxed.  I can cover the entire state and do it all over the next day if I feel like it.     
  
4.  Speaking of the beach, walking Misquamicut State Beach as the sun dropped is probably one of the most beautiful moments of my entire life.

5.  Ivy League.  Seeing a Brown football game in that beautiful old stadium beats many of the experiences I've had going to major college football games where attendance for a single game is 80K plus.   Something about the tradition of that program just makes you love the sport even more, especially when college football just seems so corrupt.   We spoke to a few undergrads while there as my sister is a Brown alum and they are just so grounded and polite.  

6.  Providence is the most underrated city I've ever visited.   I can't recommend it enough.

7.  There is nothing more to say about Newport/Block Island that hasn't already been said.  Just mind blowing any way that you look at it.

Hope I didn't annoy anyone here, but I'm just very envious of those who get to live and work here.   I love Rhode Island.

RhodeIsland,1fczrh9,RI Energy is taking us to the cleaners (with proof),"I originally was going to post this with a burner account, but mods didn't approve it for some reason. Figured it doesn't actually matter:

 RI Energy is once again proposing a huge rate hike for the winter. This is the 3rd winter in a row they're doing these huge winter rate hikes. This started as soon as PPL took over from National Grid.

Almost all power plants in New England are not owned by the utility companies. So the power plants sell their power to the utilities, who then charge you. To facilitate this, an organization called ISO-NE runs a power marketplace where utilities can purchase power wholesale from plants. ISO-NE also manages the entire New England power grid, and was created by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

ISO-NE just released a report in June stating that the 23/24 Winter energy prices (electricity and gas) were the lowest they've **been in 5 years**:

https://isonewswire.com/2024/06/12/winter-energy-prices-hit-5-year-low-internal-market-monitor-finds/

https://isonewswire.com/2024/04/29/winter-2023-2024-recap-warm-weather-low-peak-demand-contribute-to-lowest-wholesale-electricity-prices-in-four-years/

In that report, they state that the average real-time energy price for Winter 23/24 was $44.39/MWh, or **4.43 cents/kWh**. This amount is about **HALF** the wholesale energy price was for 22/23 - $79.53/MWh or 7.95 cents/kWh.

In Winter 22/23, RI Energy charged customers **17.785 cents/kWh**, and then in Winter 23/24 they charged customers **17.741 cents/kWh** despite the wholesale **cost of their energy being almost HALF** of what it was the year before.

Now once again, they're proposing a huge winter rate hike to 16.387 cents/kWh. This is insane, when you consider that Pascoag Utility District, which is connected to the same wires, the same power plants and participates in the same energy markets as RI Energy, is somehow able to secure power for a portion of Burrillville at **6.58 cents/kWh** https://pud-ri.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/PUDs-Compliance-Letter-Docket-22-40-EE-and-22-41-EL.pdf

Why is RI Energy still charging outrageous rates when the wholesale cost is at its lowest point in 5 years? How is a little po-dunk utility in Burrillville able to negotiate better rates than RI Energy? Why has RI Energy's parent, PPL, completed a **billion dollars in stock buy-backs** in the past few years, and has net-incomes of around $750 Million/year? I will admit that there could just be something about the wholesale energy market I don't understand, but when I see """"lowest electricity and natural gas prices in 5 years"""" and our energy prices are still sky high, something doesn't seem right.

I encourage all of you to write to your state reps.",1725914136,284,https://www.reddit.com/r/RhodeIsland/comments/1fczrh9/ri_energy_is_taking_us_to_the_cleaners_with_proof/,82,AmericanLocomotive,,,Government Operations and Politics,82,218

I moved over here and the “I will come to a dead stop and blinky-blinky my lights at you so you can turn left in front of me” problem is so freaking bad … I’m clearly losing it.

Then - in tandem - two black trucks stop side by side and start blinking their lights. THEY HAD NO TRAFFIC COMING BEHIND THEM. Had they just kept moving, I could have turned within 3.2 seconds.

Was there a time in RI’s history when left turns were banned? When people were stranded on roadways for months? Is that why this behavior exists? Generational trauma? 

Anyway, let’s agree on a hand signal. Not the middle finger because they are trying to be nice, so we don’t need to be mean. Not double middle fingers because I need to keep one hand on the wheel. Not a salute because they will think they are *the* Lil General. I’m leaning towards sticking my left hand out the window and giving a big thumbs down. Seems very European.

RhodeIsland,19dpbk5,Alviti should be fired or resign. Change my mind,"While I see a lot of frustration in general about the Washington Bridge situation, I continue to be shocked by how little anger there is directed toward the individuals responsible. Particularly, Peter Alviti has gotten off very easy so far.

Yes, it's fun and cathartic to joke on reddit about Rhode Island's dysfunction and say, """"Well, this is just how Rhode Island is!"""" and shrug. But that kind of response alone is pathetic. We can and should do more and care more about this. Demanding accountability from leaders is a start.

Even if Alviti himself isn't directly responsible for the Washington Bridge fiasco, he's ultimately in charge of that department.  Alviti has been the RIDOT Director [for 9 YEARS](https://www.dot.ri.gov/about/index.php) (and I find it quite ironic that his bio is essentially touting his amazing progress on bridges). It's not like he just walked onto the job recently and inherited this problem. This is clearly something that could've and should've been discovered far earlier and long before we've endured years of 195 bridge work, land closures, and resulting traffic.

We all thought the emergency bridge shutdown in December was the low point, but things are worse now. I've lost confidence in the leadership, and it's also putting our safety at risk. The buck has to stop somewhere; for me, it's at the top with Alviti.",1706019195,241,https://www.reddit.com/r/RhodeIsland/comments/19dpbk5/alviti_should_be_fired_or_resign_change_my_mind/,174,Diligent-Pizza8128,,,Defense and National Security,82,218

SouthCarolina,1fvqxjy,STOP SPREADING MISINFORMATION,"Challenge misinformation online wherever you see it. Be a calm voice of reason. State facts. Try not to get too heated. This kind of rhetoric is dangerous.

**1. “Don’t evacuate because the government is going to steal your land!”**

That’s not a thing. Hypothetically, if the government DID want your land (they don’t), they wouldn't need all these layers of conspiracy to take it. They can invoke eminent domain and must compensate you for the property. This is basic constitutional law (5th amendment). Again, that isn't happening. Anyone telling folks not to evacuate doesn’t have their best interests at heart.

**2. FEMA is confiscating/destroying/hoarding supplies and turning away help.**

They’re telling people where to drop off supplies and asking untrained individuals not to self deploy. Going out there alone without training or equipment makes you a liability no matter how good your intentions are.

**3. The government isn’t helping!**

The government is helping. They have been since day 1. The best trained rescue technicians in the nation are working around the clock. National Guard is there. 82nd Airborne is there. Air Force & Civil Air Patrol. NC Highway Patrol. FEMA. All the politicians have come and gone. The reason why it’s taking so long to reach those in need is because this is a MASSIVE disaster spanning hundreds of miles, several states, and millions of people. So far, this is the 3rd largest mobilization of federal resources behind 9/11 and Katrina.

**4. We need to rise up against FEMA!**

Why would anyone want to harm the people who are helping? Why would anyone advocate for any act that would disrupt search and rescue operations? FEMA is not our enemy and never has been. They're average folks just like us who genuinely want to help others.

**5. """"Fort Liberty is being told to stand down. They're denying soldiers leave""""**

82nd Airborne has been deployed to WNC. Soldiers were likely told they could not use personal leave to self deploy. Considering the situation in the Middle East, they're probably not granting personal leave at all right now. This is common sense.

Those are the most common examples I've been seeing. I'll update this post as needed to bring awareness to any other false narratives that emerge. A lot of it can be attributed to ignorance and gossip, but clearly there are bad actors seeking to cause civil unrest. Folks in WNC are relying on social media for information.

SouthCarolina,1as87vs,Fact-Checking Trump at his North Charleston Rally,"&#x200B;

Watching Trump’s rally in North Charleston was a truly frustrating experience for me.  Sure, some things he said were accurate, but interspersed throughout were one misstatement of fact after another. 

According to Trump, we had “the greatest economy in the history of the world,” till “crooked Joe Biden” came along and destroyed it.  In reality, the economy went downhill Trump’s final year due to the pandemic, which he, in some ways, did a poor job of responding to.  So, Biden didn’t destroy a good economy.  He inherited Trump’s bad economy. 

Secondly, Trump’s economy was not as good as he says it was. Prior to the pandemic, GDP was between 2 and 3 percent, same as it was in 2014 and 2015, and only slightly up from 2016, under Obama.  GDP under Biden was in the same range in 2022, and was actually almost 6 percent in 2021. 

Wages under Trump rose between 3-4 % annually, the same as in Obama’s final year, and they have risen much more dramatically under Biden. 

The unemployment rate went from 4.7% to 3.5% under Trump, but this was a continuation of a trend that had been going on for a long time under Obama.  After the disastrous unemployment rates in Trump’s final year, unemployment in the last two years under Biden has settled back into the 3-4% range. 

Trump has a valid point about inflation under Biden, but he fails to tell his audience that Biden’s stimulus was only partially to blame.  Other factors included pandemic related issues and government spending that occurred during Trump’s time in office.  Trump also fails to inform his audience that inflation has come down dramatically from a high of 9% in mid-2022 to only 3% today. 

At the North Charleston rally, Trump once again touted his tariffs, when in reality his tariffs have not been beneficial to the average American, simply passing on higher costs to consumers. 

Trump criticized Biden’s tax plan, and promised more tax cuts, but failed to tell his audience how he is going to prevent this from ballooning the deficit.  This same kind of thinking of reducing taxes without reducing spending has plagued Republican administrations for decades. 

Trump rightly condemns Biden’s poor handling of the border situation, but ignores the fact that, as U.S. law currently stands, people can show up at the border, claim asylum, and are allowed to stay in the U.S. until their asylum hearing.  Trump wants to fix everything by executive order when legislation is truly needed to solve the problem. 

At the rally, Trump continued to tell his story about people from a South American mental institution coming to America, even though he hasn’t been able to produce any proof of it.  He continued his false claim that he was responsible for the VA Choice Act, when this was actually passed under Obama, and all Trump did was update and expand it with the Mission Act in 2018.

At the North Charleston rally, Trump went on and on about how good his poll numbers are.  If you look at the combined polling, however, the race between Biden and Trump is very close.  Most disingenuous was Trump’s assertion that Nikki Haley’s poll numbers against Biden were terrible, when a number of polls show her beating Biden.

This was only the tip of the iceberg of Trump’s Nikki Haley misrepresentations.  He continued to repeat the falsehood that Nikki Haley supports a 23% national sales tax, when that is not part of her economic platform.  Some years back she floated the idea as part of a flat tax to replace the national income tax. 

Even more laughable was Trump’s claim that Nikki Haley wants to raise the retirement age by 10 years, followed by a completely fake scenario of a retiree finding out at the last minute they still have 11 more years to go till they can retire. 

Most disheartening to me was Trump’s repeating of his completely debunked theory that the Democrats rigged the 2020 election, while failing to tell the audience that he is facing multiple felony counts of election subversion himself.  He accused Biden of being a “threat to democracy,” when he (Trump) went out of his way to overturn the 2020 election. 

Trump, as usual, portrayed all his legal problems as the result of Democrat persecution. Unfortunately, his criminal behavior is on tape for everyone to hear for themselves, and the only reason his election subversion case hasn’t gone to trial is because of his absurd presidential immunity appeals.

In a nutshell, Trump rallies are great entertainment, but voters who want to live in a fact-based universe need to look elsewhere. The rally also raised several questions every Trump voter should ask themselves:

1. Trump claims that he could end the conflict in Ukraine by negotiation.  Does anyone seriously believe Trump could sit down with Putin and get him to give up his aspirations? 

2. Trump’s entire answer to America’s energy needs seems to be “drill baby drill.”  But what about the fact that humanity’s dependence on fossil fuels is harming the environment?  What is his plan to develop clean energy?

3. Trump voters would surely point to falsehoods Biden has told to exonerate Trump.  But, if you believe in honesty in government, how is replacing Biden with Trump going to make things any better?

This led me to build my community of like-minded people tired of dealing with this daily.

For every 100,000 live births in the state, there are around 37 pregnancy-related deaths, according to the South Carolina Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Review Committee. 
South Carolina ranks 8th highest for maternal morality in the United States. In SC, the mortality rate while pregnant or postpartum for non-Hispanic Black women is nearly 4x the rate for non-Hispanic White women!

So many women are dying during pregnancy in our state! I almost lost my wife last year when she was pregnant. Thank God, she had an outstanding medical team that saved her life and our babys. I don’t want to have another husband and father to be watching helplessly as his wife and child die in front of them. So please vote for your rights, ladies!

SouthDakota,1arlh73,BREAKING: MAGA Governor Kristi Noem is embroiled in a seedy scandal as it's revealed that she has been having an extramarital affair with top Trump advisor Corey Lewandowski — who is also married and is an alleged sexual predator.,"
The stunning revelation was first reported in The Daily Mail, which spoke to several source who attested that the sordid clandestine affair has been going on for years, since at least 2019.

Noem, the Governor of South Dakota and a rising star in the increasingly fascist Republican Party, has been floated as a possible running mate for Trump in 2024.

Ironically, Noem loves to claim that she is a strong supporter of """"family values."""" Meanwhile she has been cheating on her husband with the utterly vile Lewandowski — perhaps because she thinks it will help her career.

On top of that, Noem is an avid supporter of """"traditional marriage,"""" which is really just a euphemism for bigotry against homosexual couples. She has said that it's a """"a special, God-given union between one man and one woman."""" The hypocrisy is enough to make you sick.

Lewandowski has been aggressively lobbying to get Noem selected as Trump's vice presidential candidate. Now, we know why...

""""He may not be very smart, but it takes big balls to lobby to have your mistress named one of the most powerful people in the country,"""" said one Republican operative.

""""Every time someone said something about how Kristi would be a savior to the conservative movement, someone else would say, 'Right, the savior that's f*cking Corey Lewandowski,'"""" revealed one Trump administration employee.

The Daily Mail was able to uncover mountains of evidence of the affair. There have been dozens of trips that """"mixed business and pleasure,"""" flights on donor planes, and luxury resort visits where others witnessed them being intimate. 

On one occasion, the two were so affectionate that Noem was mistaken for Lewandowski's wife.

Lewandowski, a consummate creep, is married to a 9/11 widow and has four children. He has had other affairs in the past, including allegedly with campaign press secretary Hope Hicks.

SouthDakota,1ft71qj,Trump is part of Project 2025,"It doesn't matter if you are a Democrat, a Republican, or an Independent. Project 2025 will negatively affect each American equally. Trump WILL implement Project 2025 if he is elected president.

I really hope you take the time to read as much as you can on Prikect 2025. It's super important for every American to know what will happen if this gets implemented through the Trump administration. For those who say Trump doesn't have anything to do it. What's written and sourced below shows otherwise.

Here's a list of Heritage Foundation's(Project 2025 authors) 2016 recommendations. Trump adopted 64% of them. 

https://www.scribd.com/document/369820462/Mandate-for-Leadership-Policy-Recommendations

And here's a video of Trump giving a speech at a Heritage Foundation meeting two years ago where he outright says on video, """"this is a great group and they're gonna lay the groundwork and detailed plans for exactly what our movement will do.""""

https://youtu.be/6q8gz_Kd7KI?si=LvdBI9NEcmGFOIL9

Why does this matter? Take a look for yourself! What matters to you? This website has you pick the topic that matters to you and shows you what page number your topic is on and what will happen if Project 2025 is implemented under a  Trump regime. None of it is good for America.

https://www.25and.me/?topics=

Chatbot explaining Project 2025

https://preventproject2025.com/

Project 2025 plans to cut Medicaire and Medicaid. If implemented, it plans to jail women who get abortions pills or use contraceptives. (Which their hand was shown when the Republicans denied even a VOTE that would protect access to birth control. I wonder why that is.) 

It wants to outlaw IVF. When using IVF and an embryo is considered a """"person"""" or """"fetal personhood"""" to the Evangelicals. Alabama has already begun the process of eliminating IVF. Why? Because providers fear that """"our patients and our physicians could be prosecuted criminally or face punitive damages for following the standard of care for IVF.""""

https://www.reuters.com/world/us/three-alabama-providers-halt-ivf-after-high-court-rules-embryos-are-children-2024-02-22/#:~:text=The%20University%20of%20Alabama%20at,of%20care%20for%20IVF%20treatments.%22

It would strip away one of the tenets of our country, seeking asylum. It would deport immigrants through raids. You know?! Like Hitler did with the Jews.

It would give executive power to surveillance on citizens. Which is ALWAYS good if Trump, a sociopath who wants vengeance on his enemies (*cough*Hitler*cough*), gets his hand on that power. Now that the Supreme Court has declared that presidents are above the law, I'm sure nothing bad would happen there (heavvvy sarcasm).

Protesting would be done for. Federal law enforcement would have the power to arrest protestors and journalists. (*cough*Nazi Germany*cough*)

Voting will be all but obsolete. Project 2025 will abuse executive power to interfere in our elections by criminalizing the voting process and damaging fair representation. (*cough*dictatorship*cough*). 

I really to get this cough checked out.

https://www.rawstory.com/donald-trump-john-deere/

So, John Deere will up their prices to combat the tariff. This will put the burden on the farmers. 

This man does NOT understand how tariffs work. 

""""The Trump agenda would cause weaker economic growth, higher inflation and lower employment, according to a working paper released Thursday by the Peterson Institute for International Economics. In some cases, the damage could continue through 2040."""" 

2040!! 

https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/26/business/trump-inflation-jobs-tariffs-economy/index.html

Trump has called for adding a tariff of 10% to 20% on all imports from all countries, as well as another tariff upward of 60% on all Chinese imports.

He constantly flip-flops on whether it's 20% - which would work out to about $3,900 on the middle class, to 10% which costs them around $2,500. You got that extra lying around because you voted for Trump? 

Remeber last time he imposed tarriffs? """"HuffPost: American Families Will Pay $1,000 Per Year For Trump's China Tariffs, JPMorgan Says.""""

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/american-families-trump-china-tariffs-jpmorgan_n_5d5ade7ce4b04e1e14de8a9e?ncid=NEWSSTAND0001

Stop voting for the man that has bankrupted every business he has run. """"During the Trump administration, Congress voted at least three times to raise the debt ceiling. Under Trump, the nation added $7.8 trillion to the national debt, about $23,500 for every person in the country."""" $23,500 per person!! 

https://www.propublica.org/article/national-debt-trump

The bulk of this debt came before the coronavirus pandemic. Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, which chopped the federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, hurt revenues at the same time that administration spending increased dramatically. And then the pandemic hit. 

For the record: 'Conservative' 45 ran pre-COVID
$1 trillion deficits, now $3.3 trillion, largest %-age of GDP since 1945. -- CBO

It's time to take the Trump colored glasses off and realize that he is not meant to run a country where so many lives are at stake. He doesn't care about anyone but himself. Don't be a fool and vote for THIS 👆 again.

Official court doc:

Worth noting!! """"Throughout the document, Smith argues that the actions Trump took to overturn the election were in his private capacity – as a candidate – rather than in his official capacity, as a president. That argument flows from the Supreme Court’s decision in July, which granted the former president sweeping immunity for official actions but left the door open for prosecutors to pursue Trump for unofficial steps he took.""""

Dolan Dump has won this state with ease during the last two elections, and I would really like for him not to again. I know it's unlikely for Harris to win this state, but even if she doesn't I at least would like for it to be relatively close between her and Dump. North Carolina is a swing state because of how close it was back in 2020 between Biden and Dump, with Dump just barely winning that state. And Georgia decided to go for Biden during 2020, which makes them an important swing state as well this year. If we want Tennessee to go blue it's gonna take a lot of us to make a difference, and if Dolan does win again let's not make it easy for him which I know is saying a lot.

Texas,1g2uj6q,Why are all the Republican political commercials about trans people?,"I've seen 3 different Ted Cruz commercials over this election cycle. Literally every single one of them are """"Collin Allred is bad because he supports trans people."""" Got dinner with a buddy last night at Pluckers which obviously had CFB on all the TVs, saw the commercial about the wheelchair vet hating trans people 4 times in one hour. No mention of any political issue, no mention of any policy, no mention of any goals. No mention of anything other than trans people. Why is that the complete focal point of the campaign? I mean I guess they have access to more research and data than I do, but are there really that many voters out there hanging their vote on this one single issue? 

It's so strange to me, because regardless of whatever someone's view on trans people even is, there's no way you can argue that anything going on with trans people is a major part of politics. It doesn't effect the economy, it doesn't effect public education, it doesn't effect climate and energy, it doesn't effect social welfare solutions. Why aren't they focusing on anything that will actually effect the majority of Texan's lives in any way? Like out of everything out there to talk about around election time, and especially the things republicans like beating the drum of, you'd expect at least one Cruz commercial about immigration, but there isn't even that. Just trans people, every time. 

Again, maybe I have a misread on how much this really is an issue of importance, but I do genuinely have a hard time believing it's such an election deciding issue, making the fact that all their marketing budget is spent talking about trans people really fucking weird.

Edit: Mods please don't remove republican's responses unless they're outright hate speech. I asked the question, they deserve the platform to answer or else it's just a circlejerk.

Texas,1gebua6,"Thank you to Trump & his """"comedian"""" for making it priority one for my parents this morning to go out and vote ","This morning my dad, mom & I were discussing the things said yesterday at the Trump rally about Puerto Rico, Latinos & the watermelon comment and also Stephen Miller’s speech. My dad lived through WW2. He was a kid but he remembers some things. He definitely remembers the adults talking about it. He told me this morning, """"take me to vote today please I need to vote, there’s too much similarities between the things spoken at Trump’s rally yesterday and the words we heard in WW2 from Hitler & the Nazi party."""" 

At 80 something years old they voted today for the first time ever. Fear beats apathy I guess.

Edit: I had no idea my post would blow up like this. It’s actually surprising but funny how many comments are saying it’s bs. I honestly didn’t think it was that rare that some people just don’t vote. There’s a lot of apathy in the Latino community especially the older generation and especially in Texas. This is 100% true. I did answer a few comments with a pic I took of my parents today but covered their faces because I don’t want their faces out there. But I was being told it was a bs pic anyway so that said since this is blowing up I deleted it cuz my parents don’t need to go viral lol.

To address some of the skepticism: my parents were already registered to vote. Though they’re almost 90 they were not always eligible to vote. They were legal immigrants for a very very long time and never bothered with citizenship. Once they became citizens they were registered to vote the day of their ceremony. I’ve always checked their status and they’ve remained active to vote. This year they finally did it. No, this joker didn’t change their minds to flip candidates. They loathe Trump. This guy’s rhetoric and Stephen Miller’s scared my dad enough & pushed him to finally say take me to vote.

To the MAGA crowd that keeps saying it’s bs I’m not sorry to tell you that it’s not bs. This was a funny anecdote about what the straw was that finally broke the camel’s back for my dad so you weirdos thinking this post has an ulterior motive are just triggered but if you think that rally with all that hate rhetoric against people of color didn’t piss off or scare enough people who were probably apathetic to finally get up & vote then you’re either in denial or dense as fk. Will this flip Texas? Doubt it but if it does make sure you thank that """"comedian.""""

Texas,1geytdf,Please take my life seriously. Vote blue,"Hi everyone. I am a female born and raised in Houston. I am not usually involved in politics (I have always voted, just never talked about it, volunteered, ect.) but this election has taken a toll on my mental health to a point where I need to say something. 

I remember June 24, 2022 when I lost my right to make decisions on my own body. Texas has some of the strictest laws in the nation on abortion, which means we have some of the strictest laws in the entire world. Let that sink in. I am scared. I am scared to one day have children in this state I love, this state I call home because if something goes wrong, it very well could lead to death or prosecution.  Now Trump and Ted Cruz get to make decisions for me regarding my own reproductive health. I have less rights than my grandma did at my age. A vote for Trump/Cruz is a vote against every woman you love. 

The Trans population in Texas is 0.5%. Ted Cruz’s blatant homophobic commercials villainizing this community have brought me to tears. Most Texans have never even met a trans person, yet, this seems to be Cruz’s main priority in this election: to make people scared of them.

He really thinks we are that dumb, or hateful, and maybe we are. I am more concerned about gun violence (the #1 leading cause of child deaths in the U.S!) than the scenario of a trans person being on the school football team. Is gun violence ever mentioned by Cruz? Of course not. Trans people and their genitalia are more of a threat, I suppose! 

Come on Texas. How could you vote for someone who is openly so full of hate and ignorance? If I was a trans person, I would get the fuck out of here and move somewhere where people practice kindness. I stand by the LGBTQ+ community as an ally. You should too. 

I implore you to look inside your heart and vote with kindness, decency and sanity in mind! This election is bigger than grocery prices, the stakes are higher than imaginable. What is next, a total ban on birth control? Gay marriage left up to the states, where Ted Cruz will ban it immediately and throw all Trans people in jail? I am begging you to vote blue. I am scared.

Don’t forget Trump is a convicted felon. Religious people - don’t forget he cheated on his wife with a porn star. Don’t forget Ted Cruz fled to Cancun when Texans were dying. These are not the people I want running our country. The world is watching. Vote blue.

Texas,1bk04mk,Does anyone else notice Texas has dramatically changed?,"I was born in ‘84 and raised here. I also worked in state politics from 2013-2021.

When I was a kid we had a female left leaning governor whose daughter eventually headed Planned Parenthood. 15 years earlier Roe V Wade had been won by a young Texan lawyer. 

Education used to get 30% of the general budget for funding. People would joke you didn’t need state signs to know when you left Texas into Oklahoma because the roads in Texas were in dramatically better condition. People didn’t seethe with vitriolic foam when Austin was mentioned when you were in rural areas. Even our last GOP governor before Abbott mandated and defended making HPV vaccines mandatory. In the early 2000s the Texan Republican president’s daughter was running around like a free spirit living her best bananas life getting kicked out of bars- no one cared including her parents. The main Republican political family openly said they didn’t oppose immigration or target migrants.


I don’t remember a single power outage that lasted more than a few hours. And when they happened they were rare. We didn’t have boil water notices every year or lose access to utilities. Texas was never a utopia or shining city on the hill. It was never perfect- but it was never whatever this is.

Everyone thinks this blood red angry Texas is just the Texas stereotype but it’s not. When I was a kid Texas was a weird mix of Liberal and Libertarian with most people falling in the- mind your business category.

What we are now is a culture dictated by people who’ve moved here cosplaying a Texas conservative. Most of our Texas Republican leadership isn’t even from here. Most are from the Midwest and live in their dystopian conservative enclaves believing the conservative conformist extremism they parrot is native to Texas but it isn’t.

Seeing all the affluent suburbs packed with people wearing bedazzled jeans, driving lifted trucks, and strutting around in custom boots that cost a fortune- most aren’t from here but insist that is Texas. It’s just really depressing to see what it’s all become.

Utah,1elrqx8,What are all you Mormons who support Donald Trump thinking!?!,"I don't get it. Acceptable moral standards among the LDS faithful is typically VERY high . . .except when it comes to Trump. 

Most LDS business owners would never hire a felon, yet Trump is convicted on 34 counts of 1st degree felony FRAUD, and you want to put him in the oval office.

In this state a misogynistic womanizer would be ostracized, but Mr. Trump, who says, """"...if you want a woman, just grab her by the p***y and go."""" (His words) A man who by virtue of his close association with Jeffery Epstein is clearly involved in sex trafficing and pedophelia; and who has been convicted in a civil court of rape. Well, the Whihte House is where we want to put him.

The LDS church holds the Constitution of the United States to be a divinely inspired document. So when Mr. Trump, on Jan. 6th does everything he can to support and encourage sedition, in direct violation of his presidential oath; who publicly calls for the lynching of the Vice President; and who just rec e ntly told those at one of his rallies that if we all vote him into office in November, he will """"fix it so [we] NEVER HAVE TO VOTE AGAIN,"""" cearly intending to tear down the Constitution. By golly THAT'S the man you want as head of the free world.

It’s not personal so don’t take it as an insult when someone passes you, they just want to go faster than you’re driving. It’s neither your responsibility nor is it within your authority to control other people’s driving. If someone is driving recklessly or dangerously, call the police. Otherwise simply let them go on their way while you go on yours.

Vermont,18pb6ai,We need to stop blaming the recurring flooding on climate change,"**Title should've been """"We need to stop blaming the recurring flooding ONLY on climate change**

We have destroyed the vast majority of our wetlands, our beaver populations are still too low, we've channelized our streams, we've removed the vast majority of large woody debris from our streams and rivers, our floodplains are disconnected from rivers, and our agricultures have depleted organic matters from our soil. 

By blaming the floods on climate change we disempower ourselves from actually responding to these issues. Are dramatic rain events becoming more common due to climate change? Yes absolutely, but shrugging and saying 'Oh well that climate change' stops us from doing anything about it. The only long-term substantive response is restoring wetlands and rivers, and moving infrastructure out of the floodplain. It's called a floodplain for a reason. It's like building a house on train tracks and then blaming the train for hitting your house. I have tons of sympathy for people living in floodplains - it's a massive environmental justice issue and families are suffering. Either we provide support for communities to move from floodplains or we throw money at the problem every 1-10 years to repair flooding damage. Restoring vast areas of headwaters, floodplains, wetlands, and beaver meadows will attenuate peak flows in the larger downstream river systems and will decrease the worse effects of flooding.

Our rivers and wetlands are degraded and our legacy of deforestation and overgrazing sheep in the 1700s and 1800s and deforesting the majority of the state has depleted the organic matter in our soils so we don't have the rainwater storage capacity of our soils or our wetlands. The majority of the US has a history of removing large woody debris from rivers, either in the name of 'improving' the streams, draining wetlands for agriculture, or opening up waterways for timber and commerce. It makes me think of the meme of the guy on a bike who spears his own tire (that' us degrading out rivers and wetlands) and then blames it on climate change. 

This is kinda ranty so I apologize for that but I do have so much love and hope for our waters and our communities. I work in beaver and river restoration so I spend a lot of time around waterways and learning from people way smarter than I am. I hope this can open a dialogue and we can empower communities to restore their local watersheds.

I live in Bennington and work in Sunderland. From the start, people (particularly in the northern areas) were cold and standoffish with me. Now, I lived in the Czech Republic, so cold strangers is nothing new to me, but people in VT seemed downright judgmental. When I hold the door for people a the Stewart’s in Arlington, they don’t say thank you. When I get a drink at Ramunto’s in Bennington, people stare at me like I’m some murderer. I’ve made a couple friends, but generally people are rude and make me feel unwelcomed. It’s as if they’ve never seen a new face before. When people in Manchester hear that I live in Bennington, they treat me like I’m som kind of criminal.

I’ve experienced a lot of theft as well. Again, I’ve lived in places like Detroit and Milwaukee and never had anything. In Bennington, some random person crashed into my car my car while it was parked and totaled it. When I got a new car, someone smashed the window, stole my stereo, and left cigarettes ashes everywhere. I know this can happen anywhere, but nothing as extreme has happened to me before. It’s extremely isolating. 

For the past year, I’ve been vaguely sick all the time. I’ve felt dizzy and like I couldn’t breathe properly, and my bloodwork was all messed up. Come to find out that there was a hole
in my apartment roof and the ceiling was covered in black mold. I had to go stay at a motel for a couple weeks and some asshole broke into my car and stole all my clothes. 

To add to all that, you can’t get anything without driving at least 30 minutes to an hour. Want Wendy’s? Drive to Troy. Live in Arlington and want a reasonably priced grocery store? Go to Bennington. 

Just a gripe, but people take their local town politics WAY TOO seriously. The people in Manchester spent a full two hours debating about the color of open signs outside of businesses. Like, who the fuck cares?

I moved to VT for work and I fucking regret it. My health is compromised, I’m down a full car, much of my belongings have been stolen, and I’m just sad. If you’re in your 20s/30s and you’re thinking of moving to VT by yourself for work or something, just don’t. Take a vacation and go skiing if you wish, but don’t commit to moving here.

Virginia,1ejafk5,Has anyone else noticed the climate in Virginia shifting dramatically over the last decade?,"I have lived in VA (Harrisonburg) since 97. Over the course of the last 10-15 years, I noticed the climate has been changing dramatically. 

Back in the early 2000’s going to school it was always insanely cold in the winter, I would see frost on the inside of our windows regularly, minimum of 3-4 decent snowfalls a year, summers hot but not as hot as they are now. 

As of the last 5-6 years I have noticed a drastic change in our climate. Winters are basically snowless (maybe a snowfall or two that typically melts within a day), summers have been super dry and hot, warm weather sticks around well into October/early November. I’ve also noticed much larger insects/bugs which is more typical in more southern states, as well as random southern birds I’ve never seen up here before. 

My wife moved here from Massachusetts in 2011, and even she says she has noticed a drastic shift between when she moved here and now.

Washington,1cxaivy,Western Washington University whistleblower awarded nearly 3 million,"[MyBellinghamNow Article](https://mybellinghamnow.com/news/297792-former-wwu-auditor-awarded-nearly-3-million-in-whistleblower-case/)

Allen was hired as Director of the Office of the Internal Auditor in January 2017 and says her job was to “provide independent, objective assurance” to help improve and protect the university. She launched an investigation into the alleged “ghost courses” in November 2018 after receiving a complaint from the registrar.

Her investigation found that the Woodring School of Education had offered courses that didn’t exist to some students so their credit load would keep them eligible for full financial aid. Allen took her findings directly to the U.S. Department of Education and was told the violation could bring civil and criminal penalties, including disenrollment from the Title IX program.

University officials urged her to edit her report and remove the term “financial fraud,” which she refused to do.

President Sabah Randhawa then terminated Allen in the fall of 2019.

On May 14, 2024, a Whatcom Superior Court jury found the school had illegally retaliated against her and awarded her nearly $1.5 million in front and back pay and $1.5 million for emotional harm.",1716305031,993,https://www.reddit.com/r/Washington/comments/1cxaivy/western_washington_university_whistleblower/,97,PNW_H2O,,,Crime and Law Enforcement,76.5999999999999,602.3

Washington,1g1o3s8,The Voters' Pamphlet Makes Me Grateful to Be a Washingtonian,"I lived in Washington for six years from 2013 to 2019, and I returned to Washington last year. I've also lived in three other states, and Washington is the only one of those with a vote by mail system. There are so many things that make this state amazing and made we want to return, but our voting system is near the top of the list. 

While it's a great experience to vote in person on Election Day, in the states where I've lived, none send out a pamphlet with detailed descriptions of ballot initiatives and candidates, cost estimates, and arguments for and against those initiatives. It can be very time consuming to learn about candidates and issues in other states, which is why most voters in the US don't know a lot about what or whom they're voting for. One state I've lived in often has ballot measures that are designed to be confusingly worded, and voters there are on their own when it comes to understanding those measures and their effects.

Not so in Washington. I am so grateful to live in a state that makes voting easy and makes an earnest effort to ensure voters are informed. I got my pamphlet today, read through it, and felt compelled to share my gratitude with the rest of you! If you've never lived in another state, I hope this helps you understand how good we have it here. I love this state.

Make sure you vote!",1728692383,842,https://www.reddit.com/r/Washington/comments/1g1o3s8/the_voters_pamphlet_makes_me_grateful_to_be_a/,87,KaesekopfNW,,,Other / Uncategorized,76.5999999999999,602.3

I go to the lost and found and ask if anyone turned them in. The lady starts looking in the box…looks a bit more, looks up and asks me what they look like and where I lost them and bam. She hands me them. This is why I live in Washington. Someone could’ve stolen them but instead turned them in without expecting anything in return. This is why I love Washington. Some of the kindest people I’ve met in my life live here, for all the bad that people give Washington, there are still honest, good people here. On an unrelated note I also saw a naked lady in a parking lot yelling at people down on Pacific Ave and S 25th St or thereabouts today lol.

I decided to text 988. Not holding much hope. At first texted a long text of what was going on. I knew I would get an automated response. It asked me if if I was a veteran or lbgt+ youth and if not text next. I missed the part where it told me to text next so I got really frustrated and was about to give up on it. I did text next and it asked me a few questions and then I got a live person texting me. 
And it was so helpful. I’m so glad my temporary melt down did not lead to anything permanent. That person at 988 really did help me see that, and I felt genuinely looked after.

And my co-worker said something to the effect of """"It'll still be the least hot summer we have going forward. Every Summer we have from now on will be hotter than this.""""

Well I'm the kind of guy who recycles his cans and doesn't mind letting his lawn die back for a summer but that hit me hard. Climate change has advanced to the point where what my co-worker said is very likely to be true. Even if we have one or two outlier years over 50... we'll still average out to hotter than this summer. There's very little I can personally do about it but the reality of it is almost painful. We're gonna have more people die from the heat this summer. We're gonna see more drownings this summer from kids who can't quite swim.

WestVirginia,1bfcvul,Is anyone else disappointed and concerned with the apparent shift in WV's winter climate?,"If any of you have lived here for a considerable period of time or perhaps all of your life, you will know that historically speaking, WV has always been a four season state. We have winter too (especially in the mountains), or at least we used to. However, recent years winter in West Virginia doesn't feel the same anymore. It's super warm, abundantly windy, and there's very little snowfall to speak of.

Every now and then you might expect a fluke, maybe even two or three where winter might not show up in full form. But if you look at the historical weather records for WV, the 2020s so far coinciding with the tail-end of the 2010s have been some of the most incredibly mild winter seasons in the record books. The record books indicate that certain areas in the mountains would historically see around 30 inches of snow on average per winter season. For the past five or so years, those places have only seen a fraction of that, much lower than the average. Also, temperatures are much, much higher. Records warms being broken all the time, throughout all of the winter months.

Much like the past several years of data, this year winter again came very late, and left very early. There was one notable snow squall in January, but February and March have been downright pleasant and spring-like. It reached over 70 degrees yesterday. Everyone remembers that crazy blizzard we had way back in 1993? Yeah, that happened in mid March. It might have been an exceptionally bad storm, but snow in March is supposed to be a fairly common occurrence in WV. Historically speaking, winter in WV has tended to start by the end of November and not necessarily wrap up until later in March.

Who else remembers snow on Halloween? Who remembers temperatures consistently cold enough that snow accumulation would stay on the ground the majority of the season? Yeah, those kinds of winters are rapidly fading from memory if you live here. I find it somewhat disturbing, and a shame that kids these days don't have a clue the sorts of winter seasons we took for granted back in the day, they just don't have the opportunity to go out and play in the snow like we used to. It barely snows, and it's always super warm!

Like I said, I could accept a fluke now and then but this is clearly becoming a pattern. Just look at the historical weather records if you don't believe what I'm saying. Compare the 2010s to now, or any previous decade, the 2000s, 90s, 80s, the 70s, etc. The difference is becoming clear. It's not that the entire country is experiencing a shift to this effect, but it's more of a difference specifically here, more-so than anywhere else. Most of the other states known to get winter, have been getting winter. It's just that we haven't. It's like the warm air stream seems to more often blanket this area of the region and keep it from the more winter-like conditions we've traditionally seen, all season long. Just go on YouTube and look up winter weather videos from WV, and tell me the last time you remember a winter that resembled anything like those? It's been a while.

&#x200B;

I know the popular rebuttal for this often """"Oh well, good riddance, I hate winter"""". Climate change of any sort is never a good thing, there are so many implications. Also, I'm used to a four season climate and that's what I like to see. I'd also like for the youth to be able to have the same experiences that I did, and at this point there are some kids who've never really seen that to their lifetime because this is such a change of pattern for our weather. Who in WV would consider moving south for warmer weather, anymore? You wouldn't need to. It feels like we've all been moved. We have winter like Georgia has winter, these days. Not sure how many people are actually paying attention, but this is not just a fluke, this is like the past five or six years now of really """"weird"""" winter. I feel like it's going to become more widely recognized soon, but I'm calling it now. Something is not right. I dunno what it is exactly that's going on, but I find it concerning, and disappointing to be honest.",1710505983,320,https://www.reddit.com/r/WestVirginia/comments/1bfcvul/is_anyone_else_disappointed_and_concerned_with/,342,stilltodo,,,Defense and National Security,65,234.3

This year I spent time around Morgantown, Elkins, Green Bank, Charleston, Berkley, and Sutton. Highlights included New River Gorge National Park, Bluestone National Scenic River, Monongahela National Forest, Spruce Knob, Blackwater Falls State Park, and I absolutely loved all the bicycle trails I tried (Allegheny Highlands Trail, Green Brier River Trail, Mon River Rail-Trail System). The photo is from Paint Creek Scenic Trail -- I wasn't even trying to find some scenery, it was just a route I took to avoid a toll.

I did a lot of driving and usually took these types of smaller roads (how you all take mountain roads so fast is a separate question...) and was struck by how there was virtually no political displays on homes, businesses, churches, vehicles, or in public places.

By """"political"""" I not only mean specific candidates but also issues, such as gun rights, anti-abortion, Black Lives Matter, LQBTQ+. I didn't even see very many American flags.

By """"displays,"""" I mean anything like yard signs, window signs, house flags, bumper stickers, billboards, those church bulletin boards by the side of the road. I know it's not election time yet, but in PA you definitely still see a lot of ostentatious Trump displays (think giant cardboard cutouts, vehicles covered in stickers) that people kept from 2020, and many shows of support around issues of all types (giant anti-abortion billboards, Black Lives Matter or rainbow flags).

I thought it was quite refreshing, actually -- it added to the peaceful and friendly vibe.",1700337312,282,https://i.redd.it/4w4zzu2tv51c1.jpg,74,joyfulmourning,https://storage.googleapis.com/policy_posse_reddit_images/reddit_post_images/17yehx3.jpg,https://storage.googleapis.com/policy_posse_reddit_images/reddit_post_images/17yehx3.jpg,Health,65,234.3

WestVirginia,1b78poq,"I'm sick of just being """"middle class"""" in my HCOL area, I want advice so I may grace you bumpkins with my presence and get a taste of the high life?"," 

Greetings, beloved peasants of Backwoods wherever the fuck, WV! I’ve had an epiphany between my third latte and my daily TED Talk binge: Why not grace your adorable little backwater with my cosmopolitan presence? Yes, I've decided to descend from my high-cost urban paradise to elevate your quaint, bucolic existence.

Now, I've done my Googling in between online Pilates sessions, and I understand that your economy might be quaintly focused on """"outdoor activities"""" and """"craftsmanship."""" How delightfully archaic! Well, prepare yourselves for a renaissance, as I plan to introduce you to the wonders of telecommuting, artisan coffee shops on every corner, and maybe even a Whole Foods if you're lucky.

Let’s break down how I will magnanimously uplift your local culture and economy:

1. **Cultural Enlightenment**: It's adorable how you engage in local festivities and community gatherings. I can't wait to elevate these with a touch of urban sophistication. Think less square dancing, more silent disco. Less potluck, more curated, farm-to-table dining experiences. You'll thank me later.
2. **Economic Overhaul**: With my remote tech job's salary, I'll single-handedly gentrify—oops, I mean """"revitalize""""—your cute little town. I foresee a future where your quaint mom-and-pop shops transform into chic boutiques and co-working spaces. You're welcome in advance.
3. **Real Estate Revolution**: I've been informed your """"affordable housing"""" means I can buy up half the town for the price of my tiny urban studio. I'll start with the charming farmhouse on the outskirts—don't worry, I'll keep the exterior for Instagram. The inside? Obviously, it'll be gutted for a mid-century modern makeover.
4. **Tech Invasion**: Lastly, I’ll drag your adorable hamlet into the 21st century. High-speed internet isn't just for city slickers; even you should know the joy of streaming Netflix without buffering. And don't get me started on smart homes. Alexa will be your new best friend, I promise.

So, how do we ensure my arrival is met with the fanfare it rightly deserves? I expect a welcome committee (local artisanal gifts preferred) and a guide on how to avoid any minor inconveniences (I can't stand potholes). Let's work together to ensure my transition into your lives is as seamless as my cashmere sweaters.

With all the love and generosity one can muster,

Your Future Savior",1709654386,287,https://www.reddit.com/r/WestVirginia/comments/1b78poq/im_sick_of_just_being_middle_class_in_my_hcol/,287,deleted,,,Economy and Finance,65,234.3

It’s undeniably true (and documented at the link above) that Republican-controlled Red states, almost across the board, have higher rates of:  
  
— Spousal abuse  
— Obesity  
— Smoking  
— Teen pregnancy  
— Sexually transmitted diseases  
— Abortion (at least before Dobbs; now it would be “forced births”)  
— Bankruptcies and poverty  
— Homicide and suicide  
— Infant mortality  
— Maternal mortality  
— Forcible rape  
— Robbery and aggravated assault  
— Dropouts from high school  
— Divorce  
— Contaminated air and water  
— Opiate addiction and deaths  
— Unskilled workers  
— Parasitic infections  
— Income and wealth inequality  
— Covid deaths and unvaccinated people  
— Federal subsidies to states (“Red State Welfare”)  
— People on welfare  
— Child poverty  
— Homelessness  
— Spousal murder  
— Unemployment  
— Deaths from auto accidents  
— People living on disability  
— Gun deaths

...

But are all these things happening because Republicans simply hate their citizens and explicitly want high levels of poverty, ignorance, death, and disease? 

**Turns out there’s a much simpler answer.**

**The problem for Red states is that Republicans worship cheap labor, because it drives up profits for the fat-cats who own American businesses — and having a steady and reliable supply of cheap labor to maintain high profits** ***requires*** **widespread poverty, ignorance, death, and disease.**

Wisconsin,1en7mnn,We are fed up.,"As a Wisconsinite, one of my favorite pastimes is driving on the backroads. It’s one of the best ways to get away from life and just clear your head, and just listen to what you want. Whether that be my Pink Floyd playlist, or my favorite book series for the 57th time. 

And while I’m on these drives, I always take time to look at our beautiful landscapes. And those landscapes are so beautiful because of our farmers. I love seeing all the fields of corn, and soybeans, and corn, and cows, and corn, oh and corn. We grow a lot of corn. 

But y’know, it’s incredible, and amazingly beautiful that our farmers can grow crops on their own land, harvest them at their own time, and sell them however they want without having to answer to their corporate masters. Isn’t it wonderful? 

Too bad Donald Trump doesn’t see it that way. 

Trump supports big egg, dairy, and produce, because they have the money to fill his bank account. And let’s get down to brass tacks, if there is a small industry that has a corporate counterpart, he will support it bar none. 

I’ve said this many times, but Donald Trump wouldn’t walk across the room to have a drink with anyone who isn’t in his circle, even if they were the last person on earth. All because he doesn’t care about us. And that’s to say nothing of JD Vance. 

He is a disgrace to the Midwest, because he hates his origins but he still profits off of it through his joke of a book. And by the way, the fact that he went to Yale, and served in the military is irrelevant when he’s going around lying about his opponent for “stolen valor”, which is such bs. 

Yesterday in Eau Claire, both Kamala Harris/Tim Walz & JD Vance had rallies not 15 miles away from each other. Vance’s rally was held in a manufacturing facility owned by a billionaire. Harris’s rally was out in a field where they put on Country Jam. Vance’s rally had just over 100 attendees not including press. Harris’s had over 12,000, and people had to be turned away because the venue had reached capacity. 

To me at least, this sends a clear and direct message to the republicans, and it is this: The vast majority of Americans are sick and tired of this man taking over our country, and Donald Trump should TAKE THE DAMN HINT.

Edit: I fixed the brass tacks, and corrected Vance’s campaign location. It was still less than 15 miles away, and there were members of the public there. And it was at a place owned by a billionaire, so same difference. I also deleted the “whatever the hell that means” bit, and changed it to “which is such bs”. To everyone saying that I’m a bot, or AI, or paid off, or not from WI, or full of lies, thanks for making me laugh.

Wisconsin,1forsxu,Can we maybe not dump on rural Wisconsin?,"It's already started.  It's happened every election season.  """"Rural counties suck.""""  """"Northeast Wisconin sucks.""""  """"Red counties suck.""""  And so on.

And I get it.  I really do.  1.2 million of the states voting Republicans live in these communities and they've been no end of political headache.

But you know who else lives out here?

1 million of the states voting Democrats.  2/3rds of the states voting Democrats.

We're out here.  We're out here every day.  We're out here putting up our Harris/Walz/Baldwin signs in our front yards while living next to a Trump supporter.  We're out here wearing our """"Celebrate Diversity"""" shirts to the grocery store standing next in line to the MAGA hat wearing guy.  We're out here organizing pride events in a city that's never had them before.  We're at family gatherings going, """"Well actually..."""" when our uncle goes into another anti-Biden rant.

We're trying our best.  It's tiring, but we're trying.  We try because we love our communities.  We want our little towns to be full of love and be a welcoming place to everyone.  We didn't just pack up and leave when things got tough.  We decided to stay and try to make it a better place.

So it really sucks when you fight the good fight, then log online and all you see is fellow Wisconsinites talking about how much of a craphole your town is.  How we're all nothing but bigots.

It doesn't help.

Maybe try having our backs instead?  I'd really appreciate you for it.

Anyways...

Wyoming,19fjj6r,Wyoming Delegation Sides With Texas In Standoff With Federal Government - All three members of Wyoming’s congressional delegation say they side with Texas in its standoff with the Biden administration over border security.,">To earn permission to cut down razor wire Texas raised along the Mexican border, the Biden administration told the U.S. Supreme Court that federal agents must access the border to patrol it and do their jobs.  

>Wyoming’s Congressional delegates told Cowboy State Daily that’s nonsense, and that Biden’s border patrol has not been doing its job.  

>“The Biden administration wants to open the floodgates for cartels, drug dealers, gangs and terror suspects,” Sen. John Barrasso, Wyoming’s senior Republican delegate to the U.S. Senate, told Cowboy State Daily in a Wednesday email.  

>Barrasso took it a step further, saying it’s Texas, not the federal agents, that is defending the southern border., and that it has “every right” to do so.

>Wyoming Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis said the border crisis “could be ended tomorrow if President Biden enforced existing laws on the books, finished the border wall and brought back highly effective Trump-era policies such as Remain in Mexico.”  

>She said the Biden administration has chosen the “open border” and “is shamefully choosing to put America last.”  

>Texas, meanwhile, is doubling down by raising even more razor wire and sending its state soldiers to police the border.  

>**A Little Constitutional Law**

>U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar cited the U.S. Constitution’s Supremacy Clause, which makes the Constitution and federal laws crafted pursuant to it the “supreme law of the land.” 

>She said the lower court’s order — now vacated — that prevented Border Patrol agents from cutting the razor wire inverted the Supremacy Clause “by requiring federal law to yield to Texas law.  

>Wyoming’s lone delegate to the U.S. House, Republican Rep. Harriet Hageman, countered, saying the federal government has violated the Constitution by disregarding the Guarantee Clause.  That portion says that the United States will guarantee to its states a republican form of government, and will protect each of them from invasion.  

>“Texas has this right (to defend the border) because the Biden administration is violating the Constitution,” Hageman told Cowboy State Daily on Wednesday. “This entire situation says far more about the willful dereliction of border security by Joe Biden and Alejandro Mayorkas than anything else – actually having razor wire cut and barriers removed? It doesn’t sound like an administration that wants to secure our border in any way.” 

>**Here’s Some More Razor Wire**
 
>Texas Gov. Greg Abbott agrees with Hageman’s analysis, according to a public statement he dispatched Wednesday.  

>“The failure of the Bident administration to fulfill (these duties) has triggered (a clause giving) this state the right of self-defense,” wrote Abbott.
He’s declared an invasion and has authorized his agencies to act on their authority to secure the Texas border, the statement says.  

>Abbott doubled down after the Supreme Court’s Monday order, deploying state troops and miles and miles of razor wire.  

>To be clear, the high court’s order doesn’t bar Texas from putting up razor wire, it simply allows federal agents to cut the wire while the lawsuit is ongoing.
  
>Abbott posted photos Tuesday to his personal page on X.com (formerly Twitter), showing Texas National Guard soldiers staring out at the river through loops of tangled wire. 

>**Five Justices On Monday**

>The Biden administration asked the U.S. Supreme Court on Jan. 2, to vacate a lower court’s order stopping federal agents from cutting razor wire the Texas Military Department raised on private property in Eagle Pass, a border town and the “epicenter” of migrant influx.
  
>The high court sided with Biden in a 5-4 split. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined the liberal-leaning justices in vacating the lower court’s injunction.

>Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh would have denied the order favoring the Biden administration.
  
>But the case, Texas v. Department of Homeland Security, which Texas filed in October, has yet to be heard on its merits and is not final. The case contemplates whether federal agents break Texas law by destroying its property, the razor wire.  

…

>**Nah, Says Texas**

>Texas argued back Jan. 9, calling the federal government “duplicitous” and saying the agencies aren’t fulfilling the duties they say justify the wire-cutting.  

>“The evidence presented … amply demonstrates the utter failure of the Defendants to deter, prevent and halt unlawful entry,” says Texas’ response. They can’t “seek judicial blessing of practices that both directly contravene those same statutory obligations and require the destruction of (Texas’) property.”  

>Texas cited an “explosion” of immigration, much of it illegal. Thousands of people enter Texas daily. The annual number of Border Patrol encounters with migrants in the act of entering illegal swelled from 458,000 in 2020 to 2.4 million in 2022, the response says.  

>Texas also cited the growing industry of Mexican drug cartels, now the fifth-largest employer in Mexico and a lucrative business thriving on lax border policing.   

>**Back Off**

>Texas agents clashed with Customs and Border Patrol agents in October, when the Texans noticed the federal officials cutting the fencing. 
 
>Texas officers tried to document “this ongoing destruction,” and federal agents told them to “back the f*** off,” says the response.  

>Later, the federal agents traded the bolt cutters for an industrial-strength forklift to upheave the fence. They held the fence in the air for 20 minutes on Oct. 26, letting 300 people rush under it from the Mexico side, says the filing.  
None of those people appeared to be in distress, reportedly.  

>**Three Drowned**

>One woman and two children drowned in the Rio Grande this month on the Mexico side of the border outside Eagle Pass.  

>The federal government claims it could not save the three people because it could not access the border, while the Texas Military Department says Border Patrol agents didn’t even ask for access to the border until the drownings were over and Mexican authorities were recovering the bodies.",1706215922,157,https://cowboystatedaily.com/2024/01/24/wyoming-delegation-says-texas-can-use-razor-wire-to-stem-bidens-invasion/,102,thefrontpageofreddit,,,Health,38,124

So we bought a 4139 acre ranch McMansion monstrosity because we just love Yellowstone and know it's my destiny to live like Beth & Rip with my hubby 🥰😍. Sorry if we're pricing locals out lol.

So I have questions... is my BMW okay for the winters? Lol I hate snow and wind but my NorthFace quarter zip will be good, right? Is there anything to do? I really need a Starbucks ☕️ like 5 minutes from my house but there also needs to be huge shopping malls and high end restaurants. I'll die of boredom if I don't have these necessary amenities. 

Also, when do the park Rangers bring out the bears and wolves and stuff? I really want to get some Instagram reels to show all my followers! Who do I contact to schedule a wolf puppy 🐶 photo shoot? I absolutely *neeeeed* to be holding it for the Gram. I'll settle for riding those fluffy wild cow 🐄 things. 

P.S. do I get one of those cowboy hats when the plane lands like how you get a Lei when you land in Maui 🏝? Do I get to pick the color? Because I really want a hot pink one!

Wyoming,1b9t7ht,Wyoming’s Legislative Hypocrisy: Delta-8 Ban vs. Marijuana Decriminalization,"I’m absolutely livid and I need to vent about the blatant hypocrisy in Wyoming’s legislative process. It’s unbelievable how our lawmakers are rushing to push through a bill that will ban Delta-8 THC, yet they are willfully ignoring a much-needed bill on marijuana decriminalization and disregarding the voices and needs of their constituents.

The rush to ban Delta-8, a compound that has helped countless individuals with pain, anxiety, and other conditions, is a slap in the face to progress and common sense. The only real reason that delta 8 is harmful to people is because it isn’t being regulated so people can do just about whatever they want to it.

Meanwhile, a critical bill that could bring about positive change by decriminalizing marijuana is being blatantly ignored. This bill has the potential to reduce unnecessary incarcerations, save on law enforcement resources, and acknowledge the reality of marijuana usage in our society. Yet, it seems our legislators would rather focus on prohibitive measures than on constructive reform.

It’s infuriating to see such a clear example of legislative priorities being misplaced. Instead of addressing the real issues and considering the benefits of decriminalization, our lawmakers are choosing to perpetuate outdated and harmful policies. It’s a reminder of how out of touch they are with the current societal views on marijuana.

What happened to representing the will of the people? It’s time for our legislators to stop ignoring the evidence and the voices calling for change. We need policies that reflect the realities of our society, not ones that reinforce stigma and restrict personal freedoms. It’s high time Wyoming starts focusing on meaningful reform instead of pointless prohibitions.

If you haven’t already, contact our senators demanding change. The only reason they will legalize is if they feel their jobs are over when they don’t.

Alabama,1b7mh00,It's Supposed To Be A Secret Ballot!,"Just finished voting. At a nearby LUNCH TABLE were a mother and 2 daughters with a ballot. When I went to turn in my ballot, they were ahead of me in the line, and the mother told the poll worker, """"It's her first time voting!"""" I turned to another couple of poll workers standing nearby and said, """"Looks like they're voting by committee."""" And those 2 poll workers laughed and said they agree! 

Folks, it's not funny! It's super fucked up! For those of you who don't know, IT'S NOT NORMAL TO SIT AT A LUNCH TABLE AND VOTE, especially surrounded by other people who are collaborating or supervising on how anyone else should be voting! That is why in other states, THEY DO NOT VOTE AT LUNCH TABLES! **Everybody** gets AN ACTUAL VOTING BOOTH! I'm glad Mama is making sure her daughter votes, but she should also be teaching her to hold the secret ballot sacred.

This horrific practice of allowing """"collaborative voting"""" is especially concerning for women in abusive relationships. I've literally watched women cowed with a ballot in front of them while a husband points a finger and orders, """"Fill in this one! Vote against that!"""" Those women are just being used to allow their husbands to legally vote twice! Anybody who is old enough to vote has the RESPONSIBILITY to vote their own conscience and shouldn't be intimidated or afraid to vote their own conscience -- and that right should not be negated by polling places and poll workers who are blatantly giving the middle finger to the sanctity of the secret ballot by allowing this unconscionable """"supervised voting"""" of people who do not need assistance. Every voter in Alabama should be voting in a voting booth like voters in every other state do. And I don't mean 2 or 3 voting booths at a precinct for those who choose to use them. I mean using a voting booth to vote and protect each voter's right to a secret ballot SHOULD BE REQUIRED.",1709687321,178,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alabama/comments/1b7mh00/its_supposed_to_be_a_secret_ballot/,190,deleted,,,International Affairs and Trade,110.3,288

Alabama,1g84h6n,I HATE THE AGE OF MAJORITY IN THIS STATE.,"i’m here for university from out-of-state, where the age of majority is 18, just like almost every single state in addition to the federal age of majority.

by eighteen, i am a grown ass man. i have left my home. i’m becoming financially independent.

there is no good reason that i can think of that i should be treated as a minor.

the ramifications of this are that:

1) i have to go out-of-state *every single time* i need to pick up my medication, as a *grown ass man,* because the alabama state legislature decided that, as a grown ass man, i am not mature enough to make decisions about my own healthcare with my doctor. 

2) i need to make money, so i just tried to sign up for doordash as a side hustle. guess what? even though i’d be allowed to sign up for doordash in my home state, in addition to practically every state in the united states of america, i’m not allowed to sign up for doordash. not until i’m 19.

but while i receive the lack of freedom of being a minor, i don’t receive any benefits of it. it’s not like my out-of-state parents can be obligated to pay for my food or housing anymore. 

i am a university student. i do not have parents in the state of alabama to fall back on. no one is holding my hand like a child. so why are my healthcare decisions being prohibited? why is my ability to make money being undermined?

i’m genuinely so frustrated and my frustration grows every single day.


—


EDIT: now that five hours have passed, i’m realizing that i seem so annoyed in this post. now, i am annoyed, but i wrote this directly after being denied from doordash for being 18, so i was a little heated at the time. 

i’ve had commenters confused about why i can’t pick up my medication. unfortunately, the state of alabama banned gender-affirming care for “minors” in 2022, and i’m considered a minor as an eighteen year old. it’s extremely frustrating to have become an adult and then become a child again when i stepped into alabama; it’s extremely frustrating to have the legislature stand between my doctor and i when i am federally considered an adult. just wanted to clear up that confusion.


—


EDIT 2: i’m getting the same type of comment over and over again, so i’m addressing them here.

⠀
> “then leave the state of alabama.”

i’m fond of alabama and particularly of my university here. i don’t regret my decision to come here. that doesn’t mean i have to agree or like every policy of the state.

⠀
> “why did you come here, then?”

i got a huge scholarship, and my brother lives here. i knew that this was the position of the state, so
i’m not *surprised* that this is my experience, but i’m still frustrated. the reason i decided to overlook it is because i’m not going to be eighteen forever. i turn nineteen before the end of the year and will be able to pick up my medication then. it’s just a pain in the meantime. just because i knew about this issue beforehand doesn’t mean it’s not infuriating; it doesn’t mean i can’t discuss the absurdity of it.

most people who are asking this question aren’t just referring to the heightened age of majority, but about why i would come to alabama as a trans person. my answer is the same as above, but i’d also like to add that driving trans people out of alabama is exactly what these laws are designed to do. **putting the blame on trans people for existing in alabama instead of on the state legislature for their discriminatory legislative record blows my mind.**

⠀
> “18 is not a grown man.” / “you sound immature.”

you don’t have to think that i sound mature to agree that, by the age that most adults move out of their parents’ house, they should have the rights of an adult. there are plenty of other adults i find to be immature, but i don’t think that their rights and autonomy should be taken away on that basis. i’m financially independent and living independently. i *had* legal autonomy just before i crossed state lines into alabama. so bizarre.

⠀
> “can you try a mail-in pharmacy?”

yes, i’m going to look into it, thanks to you guys! much appreciated.


also, just so you guys know the kind of responses i’m dealing with: somebody here called me mentally ill and then proceeded to blocked ME when i civilly asked to have an actual conversation with them. i can’t imagine leaving a hate comment and then blocking that person because i’m scared of actually talking to them. made me laugh.",1729446467,323,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alabama/comments/1g84h6n/i_hate_the_age_of_majority_in_this_state/,469,pigladpigdad,,,Health,110.3,288

On Wednesday, February 14th, 2024 the bill (HB125) is being introduced to the committee. 
If HB125 passes out of committee, it will then go to the house calendar for a vote of the body! 

This bill can provide hope and protection for those that are at the hands of abusers within the church. The passing of this bill would CHANGE and hold church personnel accountable for using their power to prey on the vulnerable. There’s a law in place for educators… why not pastors?

Sexual predators should not be allowed to hide behind the walls of our churches knowing that they will not be held accountable for their crimes. It is so important that we make our voices heard to protect the children of our state!

Alabama,1c06wn9,Mental Health services in this state are a joke,"I went to college in New York and travel to Florida every 1-3 months for work. I’ve never in my life had such difficulty finding a good psychiatrist than I have in Alabama. I take medicine for ADHD and an anxiety disorder.

There’s so much red tape. Clinics are now claiming an “ADHD test” (to the tune of thousands of dollars out of pocket I bet) is required to get my ADHD medicine. I’ve been on the medication since I was 14, and can even put them in touch with the original doctor who diagnosed me. Heck, I could have written the test myself since I know the ins and outs of having the disorder.

Also, I’m not sorry that the anxiety medicine I take is off-patent, so they can’t make a huge profit by prescribing it. No, I’m not switching medications because this helps me more than others I’ve tried and has fewer side effects, just so YOU can increase YOUR profit.

I found a great doctor in Florida when I was there for work last winter, and I ended up keeping him since I couldn’t find proper mental health services in Mobile (living now), Birmingham (lived last summer), and the Huntsville area with my ex husband from 2018-2020. I found one lady in Huntsville back then who was decent, but she no longer works at the clinic.

Last night after a 13 hour shift I had a dream that I could do a lot better for myself and my family if I moved to Alabama.  When I woke up I was so convinced it was a good idea that I spent a few minutes looking at jobs and housing out there.  Looks like I could probably get a similar paying job and the cost of living is noticably lower.  I'm an electrician, btw.

Alabama,1e147wd,Map of Alabama Public High Schools,"The boys soccer coach at Sparkman High School created this and gave me permission to share here. He's very open to feedback if he is missing schools or is using the wrong logo/mascot.

Here's the original text from his post:

""""About a week ago, people on Twitter started making maps of their states with the logos/mascots of all the public high schools in each of the counties in their states. I was inspired, but waited patiently to see if someone would do Alabama (so I could steal it and print it for a poster in my classroom!) I never saw someone make one for Alabama, so I took it upon myself to create this masterpiece! Every single public high school in the state of Alabama (according to homes.com). I got pictures of logos/mascots from school websites, social media, and MaxPreps. At some point I’ll get around to moving the logos to their correct geographic location within the counties, but this was hard enough already! If you have a personal connection to any of these schools, let me know if I used the wrong logo or accidentally excluded it and I will update it. 💪🏻

Loved learning more about schools throughout the state, and I even finally figured out where the hell Albertville is—it doesn’t make the hour and a half drive seem any easier.""""",1720744359,408,https://i.redd.it/00pgr9wfgzbd1.jpeg,114,mechengabovethebest,https://storage.googleapis.com/policy_posse_reddit_images/reddit_post_images/1e147wd.jpg,https://storage.googleapis.com/policy_posse_reddit_images/reddit_post_images/1e147wd.jpg,Health,110.3,288

Alabama,18y21zl,Marion Alabama has had an on going water crisis since 2017 and nothing is being done. (UPDATE),"We’ve got some attention!! We just need to keep the pressure on our city government to do the right thing!

A city council meeting was held last night. There was a lot of answered questions and a lot of not answered questions. 

What we know- 

Our city has three wells. Two are down and one is pumping 10-25 gallons a minute instead of the normal 500-600. 
A new pump has been built and is being delivered, it should be here by next week. 
A portion of 2 million dollars of the 6 million dollar grant will be released to make sure our city leaders are doing what they say they would with the money. 
A complete overhaul of our water system is needed, we have cast iron pipes and there has been no updates since 1960. 
There could be a hole in the piping allowing air to come through. Thus allowing dirt and other contaminates as well. 
Our water is not being tested hourly right now as we don’t have the equipment to do that. 
No meters in town are working, so instead of charging you what you owe for water, they’re taking the amount owed to the water company and dividing it between citizens. They’re charging us what they want to charge us. 

What we don’t know-

Why it’s taken so long to get the ball rolling if this has been an issue for so many years. 
Why there was no clean water passed out among citizens. The last two days there have been water passed out, yet our water has been contaminated since Christmas Day. 
We can’t connect to county water until our water is tested and they’re compatible. 
We don’t know what has been done with past grants, and the questions to where money was spent at the city meeting last night yielded no answers. 

They promised communication at the meeting, yet just this morning a boil order was issued by ADEM and we had to find out via Facebook. 


I want to personally thank the councilman from Tuscaloosa that came to talk to our leaders last night, and everyone who came that wasn’t from Marion to help get us some answers. 

Hopefully with so many eyes on this something will be fixed soon. 

My personal opinion? Mayor Hinton and a lot of elected officials are in over their heads. I don’t think they know where to begin on this issue and I don’t think they’re willing to accept that they need help finding where to start. The county brought in an engineer too assess what needed to be done, but I think a 3rd party engineer needs to do an assessment. The county engineer is a conflict of interest as he has the county’s best interest at heart, and the county is known to have a bad relationship with Marion. 

Please continue to pray for us. Please continue to share the news you see. Hopefully there will be more press in the days to come to help hold our leaders to their word.

Alaska,1an4mfu,"Sealaska just published a “landmark” book about slavery in Alaska, which was practiced for decades after the US Civil War","From the press release:

“The book explores how slavery came to exist and persist in Alaska despite the federal act that banned it and examines the Tlingit, Haida and Tsimshian property laws that Native and some non-Native people believed preempted the United States’ constitutional edicts. The Tlingit also asserted they were a sovereign nation and not subject to the laws of the United States.

The practice of slavery was widespread in the region. Early Russian fur traders noted that many Tlingit slaves were Flathead Indians who had been enslaved and traded far up the coast. Individuals were enslaved as far north as Dena’ina territory, which encompasses the Cook Inlet region and present- day Wasilla, Palmer and Anchorage, and trafficked south to the Chugach on the Kenai Peninsula, the authors wrote.

Though reliable data is sparse, most estimates put the presence of slaves between ten and thirty five percent of most Northwest Coast populations.”

Alaska,198aoxq,Predatory Guiding Experience (RANT),"Matanuska Glacier is advertising directly to University of Alaska students their """"Summer Internship"""", which is being a guide for guests on the glacier. 40-hour weeks for $500 a month (Thats $3.13 an hour!!). They provide meals, showers, laundry, and """"a nice spot to camp in your tent"""" (emphasis on YOUR tent). They ask that you have an academic background in something environmental and feel comfortable being responsible for the safety of clients on the glacier.

$3.13 an hour and they don't even provide a dry place for their """"interns"""" to sleep or rest.

[https://glacier-tours.com/summer-internship/](https://glacier-tours.com/summer-internship/)

As a former Alaska glacier guide myself (TEMSCO) I was paid $13/hour with housing and utilities provided for no additional cost. This is just a disgusting use of young labor from university students so that the company owning the private enterance to Matanuska Glacier (Cook Inlet Region, Inc) can maximize their income from state-land.

All this is to say,  remember to tip your guides handsomely this summer, they probably need it.",1705431384,229,https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/198aoxq/predatory_guiding_experience_rant/,60,spacenchips,,,Health,60.3,343.3

Arizona,1eive4g,Just had one of the weirdest experiences of my life in the superstitions,"Hello everyone. I am a lifetime valley resident who decided to go on a hike at the base of the superstitions tonight. I checked the forecast and everything seemed all clear so I packed up and went out. 

It was a pretty short 2 mile trial and at about 1.5 miles in I had stopped to shine my headlamp on a wooden post to make sure I was on trail. 

Suddenly about 50 feet in front of me I hear the sound of something falling and hitting the ground and rocks tumbling all around that area. Immediately after I hear a sort of chuffing sound clearly coming from an unidentified medium-large sized mammal. 

I decide it’s probably not a predator but just in case I startled and pissed it off I grab a rock and slowly walk backwards for about two minutes. 

After I’ve determined it’s not following me I call my girlfriend for an update and a laugh. Suddenly while I’m on the phone it gets very windy and the temperature drops about 20 degrees in two minutes. 

It starts to sprinkle and she tells me a large storm cell is headed my way. Concerned about flash floods I stick to high ground and move quickly and as I’m walking checking behind my shoulder every minute or two.

At some point I look to my right and see what almost looks like an aluminum foil kite reflecting off my headlight. It seems to vanish after a second and I look away thinking I’ve imagined it. I glance in that direction and see it is still there and emitting its own bluish light. It kind of looks like someone else’s flashlight and it’s less than 100 feet away from my off trail. 

Suddenly i kid you not it shoots up into the sky so quickly I thought someone had turned their flashlight up to the sky and it was reflecting off the bottom of the clouds. 

It disappeared after 3-4 seconds in the clouds. I realize it would have to be an incredibly strong flashlight to reflect off the cloud so visibly especially without growing larger as it went further (it remained seemingly the same size). 

Im not certain at all what I saw but im guessing it may have been ball lightning. Anyways I made it to the end of the trail safely just as the storm cell got overhead and starting dumping on me. Fortunately totally fine but definitely a weird night 😂.

Edit: I am 100 percent certain I did not encounter the supernatural or an alien lol. After looking online I’m guessing the animal was a javelina and I’m about 80 percent certain I saw ball lightning.

Arkansas,1fussvm,Who is John Thurston?,"Recently Arkansas Secretary of State, John Thurston, has been brought back into the spotlight following another incident in which he failed to count tens of thousands of signatures for a measure that would be on this years ballot.


Thurston first drew attention as the state’s Land Commissioner when he spent almost $30,000 on a sporting boat that was supposedly purposed for removing debris and large obstacles. The boat - which the War Eagle manufacturer crafts as part of their Sportsman lineup for fishing and hunting - was never used for official state business. 


Thurston’s more recent controversies are a bit more complicated, though even more nefarious, than his state purchased fishing boat scandal.


Arkansans for Limited Government (AFLG) had collected over 102,000 votes for the Arkansas Abortion Amendment (originally called The Arkansas Reproductive Healthcare Amendment, the title was changed as part of the second certification request in December 2023) which would allow abortion in some situations such as: rape, incest, fatal fetal anomalies, or to protect the life of the mother within the first 18 weeks of pregnancy. 

Currently all forms of abortion are outlawed in the state of Arkansas unless the mother’s life is at risk; with the highest maternal mortality rate and the third worst infant mortality rate in the nation, it’s obvious that changes need to be made.

Even though AFLG had worked closely with and submitted paperwork to Thurston’s office throughout the process, Thurston refused to count 14,143 signatures that would have required him to certify the issue for the forthcoming elections and voting ballots.  This is due to Thurston’s office claiming that required documents were not submitted properly, though the Sponsor Affidavit was submitted at least 17 times and the Secretary of State’s office told AFLG that they no longer needed to submit more.

This would be the downfall of the amendment petition as even though Thurston’s office told the activists that they had submitted all necessary paperwork, any signatures after their last affidavit was delivered would not be counted. 

The court added further fuel to the fire by dismissing Thurston’s staff’s failure to collect necessary documentation, stating “the burden of determining what the law requires falls on the filer—not office staff.”

As it stands, the Arkansas Abortion Amendment will not be included on the 2024 ballot. AFLG has taken this opportunity to focus on the next voting year, 2026, and hopes to have the issue in front of voters during that cycle.


In the past few weeks, Thurston has made another volatile decision in refusing to count more than 60,000 endorsements gathered by citizens across the state. These signatures were collected by Arkansans for Patient Access (APA) in an effort to push the Arkansas Medical Cannabis Amendment of 2024 onto this years ballot. Over 150,000 Arkansans showed up to add their names to the list in hopes of expanding healthcare providers and pharmacies, faster treatment, right to grow, legal protection for doctors, as well as stricter regulations that would help protect children and consumers.

Out of the 150,000 signatures taken, Thurston counted 88,040; just 58% of the actual number collected. In order for the Secretary of State to certify the issue for the ballot, he would need to count 90,704. What was the cause of invalidating Brady half the endorsements garnered?

Well, there isn’t much of a reason. After the Attorney General’s office certified the popular name and ballot title for the amendment - opinion 2024-037 which was approved in February - Thurston’s office accepted the submission as well. 

Once APA got the go ahead from both offices, they started collecting signatures. They hired Nationwide Ballot Access, or NBA, in order to “recruit, qualify, hire, and train paid canvassers to solicit signatures on behalf of APA.” NBA submitted affidavits from paid canvassers under instruction and permission from APA. NBA submitted more than 110 separate submissions to Thurston’s office, all of which were accepted and “made clear that NBA was acting as an agent of APA.” The Secretary of State’s office would then enroll each individual as paid canvassers for APA. These petitions included more than 111,000 signatures from registered voters. 

On the last day of July, Thurston’s office sent a letter to APA advising that they had finished their “initial review of the petition” and that there were “no less than 77,000 valid signatures.” They gave APA a 30 day timeline to collect enough signatures to reach the 90,704 goalpost.

As there was no input as to why the remaining 34,000 votes were invalidated, APA collected thousands more signatures utilizing their canvasser, NBA. A little over a week later, one of Thurston’s agents wrote them another letter.

This letter dictated that any signatures collected by NBA on behalf of APA would not be counted, nor would any additional endorsements gathered by NBA, “for any purpose.” This decision was based on the Secretary’s new position that an agent of the sponsor couldn’t make the certification to Thorton’s office.

This is a direct contrast to previous ballot initiatives that have allowed submission and certification on the sponsor’s behalf. Before the letter sent out August 8th, Thornton’s office had had no issue approving such efforts. And so, out of the 38,934 new signatures gathered only 10,521 were counted. This brought the total counted to 88,040. 

Bill Paschall - an attorney of Little Rock, AR - along with APA, have filed suit against John Thurston over this intentional miscount. They believe the situation to be “nonsensical” and that the Secretary and his office have overstepped, as a Special Master in the recent McGill v Thurston case (a separate case in which the Secretary also declined to count votes from delegated agents) determined Thurston’s argument to be false. Even so, Thurston chose to use the same tactic in the case of the Arkansas Medical Cannabis Amendment of 2024. 


While this case is still ongoing, the circumstances beg for taking a look at what this means for democracy in the state of Arkansas. Whether you are for expanding healthcare for women in the form of medically necessary abortions, or against passing legislature that would protect doctors, patients, and children like that of the aforementioned cannabis amendment, this is deeply troubling.

Already, Arkansas passed House Bill 1419 in 2022 which makes it more difficult to get important issues on the ballots. The continued restrictions - artificial in the case of Thurston - are making it harder and harder for citizens voices to be heard. When enough of the state (90,704 Arkansas across 50 counties) does put their blood, sweat, and tears into gathering or signing petitions, it’s expected that those in charge will approve of initiatives without bias.

Instead, Arkansas hosts a Secretary of State who is keen on creating new rules and enforcing them as he pleases in order to block important matters from being voted on. In the words of a local musician, H. Wyatt Caraway:

>>Who is John Thurston? He blocked our vote.
>>Hundred thousand signatures, but he tossed them out.
>>Silenced the people instead of lifting them up,
>>Now he wants more power and he’s asking for trust. -Who is John Thurston?",1727907861,159,https://www.reddit.com/r/Arkansas/comments/1fussvm/who_is_john_thurston/,35,HoppyTaco,,,Health,145,430.3

Arkansas,1dg2fsq,Gov. Sanders announces pay raises for select state employees,"As a former state employee let me tell you how this works. There are people called political appointees in our state government. To my surprise this fact was openly discussed in large meetings and it wasn't too difficult to identify those appointees. The opposite of these political appointees are called technical employees. These are the people who know what they're doing and have experience and a relevant education. 

These merit based pay raises have been around for a while. Basically everybody gets assigned a 1-5 in different areas. Supervisors are told that they only get to award so many fours and fives regardless of """"merit"""". Depending on your number you get a certain percentage raise. 

About 5 years ago, myself and some colleagues decided to look at the published salaries of various employees in our department. You could compare one year to the next and do the math and figure out the percentage of each person's pay raise. And what do you think we found? You guessed it. The political appointees got all the fives. 

I'd be willing to bet these raises are again going to be going to those political appointees, and quite potentially nothing going to the other employees who actually do the work and solve the problems. What is the goal of this? It's quite brilliant. The governor's friends get your tax dollars, and the state employees continue to quit and retire en masse. 

If you're someone who thinks our state government services are inept and incompetent, you are correct. They're kept that way.

Arkansas,1ebzmqu,Question to Arkansans in support of reducing funding to public schools.,"I'm not picking a side or advocating, I'm just genuinely curious about something:

A few hundred years ago there were no public schools. Only the rich could pay to educate their children. At that same time, the church of Christ was the dominant source of knowledge for the lay person: poor children were educated through the teachings of Christ. At that time, there was very little medical knowledge, little mathematical knowledge, astronomical, etc.

If people are now voting to (a) introduce Christian teaching in schools at the expense of other non-religious pedagogy, and (b) to keep taking funding away from public schools, then how do you not see this movement as a regressive step back into the dark ages of humanity?

Arkansas,1b9tuxa,Our natural beauty is unmatched in Mid-America,"You will not find a more prominent mountain than Mount Magazine within an 11 hour drive in any direction.

You will not find a taller waterfall than Hemmed-in-Hollow within a 10+ hour drive in any direction.

You will not find clearer lakes and more scenic rivers than you will in the Ozarks and Ouachita’s in a 12+ drive in any direction.

You will not find a taller sheer cliff than Big Bluff in a 12+ hour drive.

You will not find better mountain biking in a 12+ hour drive in any direction.

Our state has an estimated 300 waterfalls. That is more than Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota, Minnesota, and Illinois combined. That’s 76 million people in middle America that have access to fewer waterfalls in their combined states than the 3 million here in Arkansas do.

We have one of the worlds only public diamond mines.

Sure, Missouri and Oklahoma get the leftover scraps of the Ozarks and Ouachita’s but the best in mid-America is right here.

Connecticut,1cd06yz,What's the speed limit on the I-95? Am I losing my mind?,"Hi Connecticuties, British person here who recently did a roadtrip through your state for business. 

I don't have much experience of American roads, so perhaps this is a country wide thing, but I'm asking here because it seemed **bizarre** to me as an outsider.

ALLLL up along the road, at very regular intervals, there are big signs that say """"Speed Limit 55MPH"""". Me being a person who does not want to get a speeding ticket in a rental car, set his cruise control to 55 and... was immediately surprised that I was being the slowest person on the road by *at least* 10MPH, most other people driving at 65-70.

Now, 70MPH is the speed limit on British motorways, and that is a speed I'm comfortable driving at so I decided to match the rest of the traffic and drive faster, but that just left me very confused.

What's going on here? Is it:

1. Everyone speeds and nobody gives a fuck
2. The posted speed limit is incorrect and there's a hidden rule that you're just supposed to """"know about""""

Connecticut,17vxg8q,After School Satan Club is signing up students at a CT elementary school to counter Good News Club,"Christian and satanist organizations that sponsor after-school clubs throughout the nation — the latter often swooping in to counter the Christians' message — have made a small town in eastern Connecticut the latest center of their epic struggle.

The Salem, Massachusetts-based Satanic Temple recently announced a new After School Satan Club at Lebanon Elementary School, the same school where the Warrenton, Missouri-based Child Evangelism Fellowship has been running a Good News Club. 

The After School Satan Club (""""Educatin' with Satan"""" is the motto) is to hold its first session at the school on Dec. 1. Nine students have signed up, with their parents' permission, and five adults, including two leaders of the regional Satanic Temple, have volunteered as activity leaders, club campaign director and Satanic Temple minister June Everett said

""""ASSC exists to provide a safe and inclusive alternative to the religious clubs that use threats of eternal damnation to convert school children to their belief system,"""" according to the Satanic Temple.

Connecticut,1budleg,"After my post with Rep. Mark DeCapario blew up, he called me and we talked for 45 minutes. Thanks everyone for the talking points and you can read all about it.","Hey there everyone, I spoke with Rep. Mark DeCapario (R) from the 48th District. I am a Colchester resident and Rep. DeCapario is from Lebanon- which is an important tidbit for later.

First, thanks /r/Connecticut, you questions and insights were great [and created an amazing dialogue.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Connecticut/comments/1bpa7lz/so_i_reached_out_to_my_state_rep_about_eversource/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) I also published Senator Norm Needleman's response [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Connecticut/comments/1bpznrt/yesterday_we_heard_from_a_state_rep_about/)

TL:DR- the bolded stuff is his comments.

&#x200B;

1. CEO pay- """"**the board of decides it""""**
2. When asked about how to lower prices, **he said competition**. I asked how, he was against any government regulation I could name. I asked how would a company beat a monopoly, **there was no answer to that, part but he did say, """"competition"""" but did not elaborate on what the state would do to create that competition.**
3. I asked why we are focused on 160 million dollars on some people's bills and not the 1 billion in yearly profit. That billion is paid by us year over year. ***""""That's fine""""***
4. When I asked, if you do not regulate Eversource, the company is a monopoly, they are for profit, and everyone has to have what they are providing, what can be put in place to ensure that they are a good acto? **He said that he """"wasn't sure"""" and """"I was raising an interesting point.""""** 

Ok everyone, I will do my best to summarize our call, I did take some handwritten notes but our conversation went on for about 45 minutes. Here is the the very long and not so short of it in bullet form. I have my own personal thoughts at the bottom. Sorry, this is a novel, buckle up.

&#x200B;

1. **He said that it was not up the legislature to regulate Eversource, it is PURA. He mentioned multiple times that Eversource and utility bills are not areas he is as familiar with.** I said to him that while Eversource is regulated by PURA, it is his job to create any new laws or regulations so that point was not completely fair. I asked about the pay of the CEO and other C suite executives and he was not able to offer a reason for their pay, what they could do during the 9 to 5 that justifies their pay, or what markers we as customers and representatives can look to with why that pay is fine. I mentioned that the 19 million dollar price tag is just 1 figure, not all the higher ups, and the 160 million dollar figure on back payments starts to not so daunting in comparison. **He said he didn't agree with what they made but that was determined by the board.**
2. When I mentioned socialize loses and privatizing profits in which I cited Millstone, **he was not familiar with what I was speaking of.** We come back to this idea later but I moved on rather than talk about a point he wasn't familiar with except to say that we do pay a delivery charge and that the state's bailout amounted to a de facto tax increase. Special shoutout to /u/eddie964 for this bit
3. **He did mention that Eversource does not run the whole state and that he personally has Bozrah Public Utilities.** I asked him, """"Do you receive complaints from the people that are served by them?"""" **He replied, """"no, never, not one.""""** I cycled back to when we first started talking and how **he said that, '(he) keeps getting emails and calls about (Eversource)'** and I asked him why he thinks that is he only gets calls about Eversource and not Bozrah.  I pushed back on this and he replied, **""""I have limited exposure on this subject.""""**
4. At this point, I changed topics to move away from the """"I am not familiar with"""" line and go straight to the heart of the matter- electricity is a need, we have a monopoly, and they have a profit motive. I asked about Hurricane Sandy and how Eversource said they will improve. They still fail us any time there is wind over 40 mph and they get crew from Canada. What incentive is there for them to improve their infrastructure or their response? What about the for profit nature ensures that the infrastructure costs are addressed by Eversource as you stated in your letter? (I quoted that section to him)
5. **This prompted by an immediate subject change and asked me about electric vehicles (EVs) and hit the talking about about banning gas vehicles and if I supported it.** I said that EVs are cheaper than gas, that the bill is not a ban, it will be a phase out, that the biggest issue I would want to see addressed as a family would be the state assisting with paying with the hookup costs at residents for a place to charge the EV, and that if California passes the law, then its going to be the default way that cars will be regulated and looked at in the nation via automakers. 
6. **He replied, well what about the massive costs to the infrastructure that Eversource will have to do in response to pay for this change to EVs?** I said, it is a monopoly and for profit-what incentive do they have to ensure that the market for EVs and upgrading their infrastructure isn't passed onto the customer already at an increased profit? That cost is already happening and will continue. It is going to be something that we will all need regardless of whether the bill before the Legislator is pass due to the California rule change. **He did not have a reply about the default change of things due to California essentially being the main point of regulation in the nation.He said that the house hookup costs would be high and that he was not sure about paying for the hook up for each family. He** 
7. I cycled back again to that previously asked question on line 4 and asked him about what he said about Eversource and how being for profit was the only way that Eversource can stay on top of those expenses. I asked him again how that was and **he stated that PURA is the regulatory body.** I asked him if he can think of any reason that their being a for profit company would make infrastructure better and **he said that he could not think of one but that regulation could be an issue.**
8. I stated, if that was the case, why after Hurricane Sandy when Eversource said and were told to do better, why have things not gotten better? I pointed to the fact when it is slightly stormy, we lose power and they get crews from Canada to keep costs down instead of fixing things. What does their CEO that makes 19 million do that is so special? **""""They make what they make, it is up to the share holders to decide what he should be paid."""" He stated he personally did not agree with their pay and said that he could not think of what job the C suite executives could possibly due ensure they get their salaries.** 
9. I moved the subject onto COVID payments and freezing pay and asked if it was good or bad. **He stated """"it was something that happened.""""** I asked again, is it good or bad. **""""Its not good, that cost is passed onto the consumer...it is important to keep things as affordable as possible.""""**
10. Great I said, that 160 million dollars is 44.44 dollars per person in CT for a single month. How does that compare to a billion dollar profit. **""""That's fine"""" he said.**
11. My bill though is higher because of that yearly 1 billion profit. **""""The market will dictate the price. There can be unintended consequences with a government mandate.""""** I replied, people do not care about public vs private, just the cost and if it works and if there is no corruption. I cited people being married to Eversource executives while being on PURA, the costs being so high, and all our outages. We also had a regulated market years ago and our costs were lower. **He said that method from years ago wouldn't work but he did not know this was the case prior to regulation.**
12.  I then moved to how can the market dictate the cost of a monopoly utility? **""""You may laugh at me but the market has some control with the transmission of the electricity with who supplies it but you probably know more about it then I do. You know that I am a Republican and the legislator doesn't look like that.""""** I asked how can a monopoly have competition to lower prices and he said, **""""oh Eversource isn't the only utility in Connecticut. They would lower their prices through competition.""""** 
13. I asked what would, if he could, create a bill and get it passed, if it didn't go to committee and was put on the floor etc. **He said that he would """"create a market with competition.""""** I pushed hard on this one, saying that this is a for profit monopoly and that unless the state intervened and broke up Eversource or if they created a new power company, this isn't possible. **He said he wasn't sure about the mechanism he would use to create this competition.**  
14. I then moved the topic back to a point I raised earlier about why I was calling, namely Colchester cutting out full-day preschool and how harsh the cost of daycare is, electric bills, and so on actually are. I told that I heard the same lines that he used about """"keeping taxes down"""" but what that meant is that Republicans in my town cut expenses to save everyone a couple of dollars but it meant that any family with preschool aged children had to spend thousands upon thousands of dollars on daycare. That we planned for preschool and when services are cut and removed, it can have devastating affects on his constituents. That many families are spending thousands upon thousands of dollars that we didn't think we had to because """"cutting budgets"""". 
15. *If I can offer my opinion here, I think this story had the most affect on him because my wife and I planned out our expenses, that we knew that we could afford everything but that massive expense hit us hard and made our finances go from saving money to being one of those many paycheck to paycheck families that the news always mentions for puff pieces. I think this type of thing resonated more with him than asking about macro things about competition, monopolies, and utilities. He was about to get off the phone but when this came up we talked for another 10 plus minutes. I made it a point to remind him that if he was in the business of taking things away, it can crush people and families in unintended ways. While I do not think I converted him, it was good to get a real conversation in instead of talking around in circles about things he doesn't want to say because I do not think he cares about it. I do not think he wants to change anything and I think the state and any government is a boogeyman which is an issue when its literally your job.* 

&#x200B;

Lastly, what about DEI? Diversity, equity, and inclusion practices have been making headway in Republican talking points and I wanted to ask him about it. **He paused for a good five seconds and said, """"My personal philosophy is if you have a different view, we should respect it.""""** 

""""Are you saying that DEI is not respectful? What do you mean about respecting viewpoints?""""

**""""Some of the teaching on that, in school I would be cautious of- school should be school and we should leave politics out of teaching children.""""**

I did say that everything he said was wrong and that DEI is about ensuring that all students are included in a classroom and its entirely apolitical. I encouraged him to actually talk to someone about it because teachers do not have time to deal with politics in the classroom, they are too busy with making sure that behaviors are manageable. I talked about my work when I was in schools and how school is about creating an adult that is able to navigate the world and that what he was talking about just does not happen in any classroom ever. Not interested and in my opinion, I think this is another area he truly believes the talking points. 

**Hey look a second TLDR**. It is frustrating having a conversation with someone that knows they are getting complaints and thinks that everything is fine. I felt like I was bashing my head against a wall because he focused a lot on those people that did not pay but when I mentioned over and over that the billion in profit is a billion in COSTS that we all pay for, that is a higher COST to each of us, that you are focused on COST to the taxpayer but to just get a """"that's fine""""...man it was frustrating. 

It was also incredibly frustrating to hear, you know more than this, I am not sure etc etc. It reeks and it is frustrating to hear, especially when you know that so many people are writing and calling about it and you either can't be bother to learn more, care, or who knows what. I think this was a disingenuous attempt to ignore directed questions and it is obvious.

And if I may pontificate even more- while yes, I am sure many of you will say, """"that's a politician for you"""", I disagree. I was happy to hear from him and talk to him for 45 minutes and I do not think he should represent me. I think the problem here is that he legit thinks that the way things are is fine, nothing is wrong. Politics is local and at the end of the day, the response from this community and the information he gets from his constituents shows he is wrong. I think the issue is the people that we send  and if they have the drive to fix a problem head on.

Connecticut,1c5hqfq,Unpopular Opinion (for New Yorkers): Connecticut has the best bacon egg and cheeses,"I grew up in Fairfield and have lived in NYC my whole adult life, about 18 years. One of the most stupidly frustrating things to me is how much credit NYC gets for their deli breakfast sandwiches, when they’re generally mediocre at best.

New York BECs: Scrambled low quality eggs, yellow American cheese (a tangier flavor compared to white and generally works better for burgers and chopped cheeses), low quality bacon that’s often under or overcooked (and may be turkey or beef bacon without warning), stale or low quality rolls (or bagels, which in my opinion get in the way of what makes these sandwiches good), cooked with haste and no love. Even if it’s cooked right it’s still just meh in too many cases. I’ve never found a place here that I can truly rely on to be awesome every time, and never have I found a spot I would prefer over the all the places local to me when I stay in CT.

CT BECs: Good quality fried eggs, white American cheese (so much tastier and even has a bit of sweetness to it), consistent perfectly cooked good quality bacon that’s always from a pig, fresh soft rolls, cooked with love.

Like I said, I’m from Fairfield, but I’ve never had a mediocre one anywhere I’ve gone there, and I get them many times throughout the year.

The Country Cow, The Tasty Yolk, Pine Creek Deli, Firehouse Deli, Reef Shack, the now closed S&S Dugout, Gruel Britannia, Harborview Market, and more I may not know about yet. All offer great ones that always taste the same every time, and some have some really signature aspects to their sandwiches. The Tasty Yolk’s roll is mind blowingly good and unique. Pine Creek Deli has “The Shredder” which is filling af but crazy good. Gruel Britannia offers their British spin on breakfast sandwiches but you can still get a traditional one. Each place just seems to understand what makes a good one truly good. Btw, please feel free to recommend other great spots in the area if you know em.

I hate that in NYC I’ve only found especially good ones at places where you have to sit down and tip a waiter. I think it also just makes me sad that people in the city think they’re eating something so good and special, when really they just don’t know what they’re missing. People in NYC can be seriously arrogant about this topic too.

Does anyone else feel this way or is it just me? I’ve never had anyone provide a successful argument for why NYC should be considered the best. They just have a high quantity of places that make them, and I think a lot of people who grew up here are simply nostalgic for the deli BEC because they’ve known nothing else.

Tldr: CT breakfast sandwiches are an orgasm of flavor, while NYC’s are like paying for an unenthusiastic handjob in a car.",1713278336,274,https://www.reddit.com/r/Connecticut/comments/1c5hqfq/unpopular_opinion_for_new_yorkers_connecticut_has/,206,iStealyournewspapers,,,Defense and National Security,186,444

The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a case Monday challenging Connecticut legislation that repealed religious exemptions for school vaccine requirements in 2021. In a lawsuit, three Connecticut parents and two organizations, We the Patriots USA, Inc., and the CT Freedom Alliance, had argued that the state was violating their First Amendment rights with its passage of Public Act 21-6, which eliminated the ability for Connecticut families to apply for a religious exemption to mandated immunizations when a student is enrolling in school. 

The plaintiffs sued the state departments of education and public health, the Office of Early Childhood Development and three local boards of education.

Brian Festa, co-founder and vice president of the nonprofit, called the Supreme Court’s decision “disappointing,” and “heinous.” But the battle is not over for Festa’s organization.

Festa said one claim from the case remains active within the district court regarding students with disabilities and whether “special needs children are entitled to receive an education, even if they opt out of vaccinations.”

Connecticut,1emisq2,Connecticut court rules transgender people in prisons can get gender-affirming care - CTMirror,"[Click here to read the full story. No paywall.](https://ctmirror.org/2024/08/07/ct-prison-transgender-health-care/)

After a five-year legal battle, the U.S. District Court recently ruled that transgender people incarcerated in Connecticut prisons are entitled to gender-affirming health care. 

Veronica-May Clark originally filed the case in 2019, and the American Civil Liberties Union offered her representation in 2021. Clark, who has been in custody since 2007, alleges that after a diagnosis of gender dysphoria — a medical diagnosis for someone who experiences distress that can occur when their true gender does not match with their outward appearance and/or the sex they were assigned at birth — her treatment from the Department of Correction was inconsistent. 

“At the end of the day, she just wants health care,” Elana Bildner, Clark’s attorney with the CT ACLU, told The Connecticut Mirror. “She wants the health care to be consistent, to be adequate, to be appropriate \[and\] to be able to rely on the fact that she will get this health care that she needs for the long term.”

As a result of the DOC’s continued delay of her requests, she says, her symptoms worsened, and she experienced serious self-harm and hospitalization.

Connecticut,1ffuj72,Reddit post prompts investigation of state police officers,"Connecticut State Police is conducting an investigation into officers’ possession of political campaign material while on duty, the agency confirmed this week

photo posted Labor Day on social media site Reddit shows three Connecticut State Police officers in uniform, one holding what appears to be a Donald Trump bumper sticker.

In response to an inquiry from CT Insider, a spokesperson said the matter had “been forwarded to the Professional Standards Unit for further review.” 

“This is now an internal investigation,” the spokesperson said. 
It is unclear what policy is for state employees and, specifically, troopers and what involvement in political activity is allowed both on and off duty. Connecticut State Police did not immediately respond to a request for copies of written policy regarding political activity off and on duty, referring the request for legal review. 
In 2016, a pro-Trump sticker was seen on a Hartford police laptop used inside a police vehicle. Then-Hartford Deputy Chief Brian J. Foley told NBC he had reminded Hartford officers to """"remain politically neutral.""""
In a separate incident, East Hampton officer Kevin P. Wilcox was found to be a member of far-right extremist group the Proud Boys. 
Wilcox was not disciplined for his membership in the group, the Associated Press reported, and East Hampton Police Chief Dennis Woessner said it did not violate departmental policies.

Delaware,1drmhf6,Big fish grill gone downhill,I used to go to Big fish grill every year for my birthday and every time it was my turn to pick a restaurant.  I even had them cater my wedding in 2020.The past 3 times I went to the one on the riverfront in Wilmington and the last 2 times I went to Rehoboth the food quality has decreased significantly. I would always get the salmon and it was slimy and not as good as normal.  So tonight my MIL wanted to go for her birthday and we went and it was awful. I got the seafood chowder and it was super bland and not any seafood in it that I could tell. So I only took a couple spoons of it. Then my entree was the big fish penne and the 5 shrimp in it were tiny and there was no flavor to it. It tastes like plain pasta even though there was a lobster sauce on it. I could not taste anything from the sauce. I decided to try the Apple Cobbler dessert and it was all crisp and a couple apple slices. I am gutted as this was my favorite restaurant and now the food is all terrible that I have tried. My husband agrees as well. Just was wondering if anyone else feels they went downhill in the food the past 2 years or just me?,1719699283,69,https://www.reddit.com/r/Delaware/comments/1drmhf6/big_fish_grill_gone_downhill/,54,Cosmicweekend,,,Agriculture and Food,59,153.3

Delaware,19fe7kt,License Plate Posts are no longer permitted,"Hello r/Delaware,

The moderation team has decided to make a change that we will enforce starting now.

From this point forward, **license plate photo posts will be removed and any other picture posted must blur or obscure any legible license plates**. The trend has moved away from only posting low digit tags to posting any random tag. Beginning today any new post with a legible license plate will be removed.

The License Plate Flair has been disabled.

Owner of a local liquor store here hoping for feed back.  This past year has been an interesting one for our industry.  Many retailers reporting a slow down in sales.   If you don’t mind sharing how your drinking habits have changed post Covid I’d really appreciate it.  There are several theories that all make sense. Do any apply to you ?

Inflation?  We have seen dramatic price increases over the past 2 years like most other places.  Is alcohol something you have traded down on or eliminated due to inflation ?

Marijuana?   Has recreational marijuana being more available in nearby states led to you drinking less ?   

Focus on wellness ?  Covid has made us all take a closer look at our health and wellness.  Has this made you change your drinking habits ?

Something else ?   


Really appreciate any feed back or comments.

Cheers yall

Delaware,1cgvr6e,Update: Moving to Delaware Posts,"Hello r/Delaware,

Last week we [posted a poll](https://www.reddit.com/r/Delaware/comments/1cb2ir4/should_we_disallow_moving_to_delaware_posts/) asking the community if we should disallow """"Moving to Delaware"""" posts. The result was to continue to allow these posts by a 2 vote margin. We are surprised by the results and will respect the outcome.

After considering some of the comments we have added a new sub rule outlining the requirements of moving to Delaware posts and have created a new wiki page to provide additional resources. In short we'll remove posts that ask basic questions that are answered in recent posts or the wiki; as well as low effort posts without sufficient information for replies.

The new [Moving to Delaware Wiki Page](https://www.reddit.com/r/Delaware/wiki/index/moving2de/) is a work in progress and is lacking on helpful data for areas below the Canal. I'd like to ask for volunteers from the community to help build out some details for MOT, Dover, Kent, and Sussex Counties. Please respond in the thread if you would like to help. We'll select a few volunteers and give you permissions to update the wiki.

~~3:00 PM ET Edit - It appears that the Wiki cannot be viewed in the mobile app (which is really stupid). Therefore we'll have to find an alternate location for it.~~

6:45 PM - Edit 2 - the Wiki link above works now in mobile!",1714491155,76,https://www.reddit.com/r/Delaware/comments/1cgvr6e/update_moving_to_delaware_posts/,43,7thAndGreenhill,,,Crime and Law Enforcement,59,153.3

Delaware,1859r9k,"Urgent Request, Need Kidney Donor","I know it is a big ask, but thank you for even hearing and considering my request.

I’m a father of 3 kids living my family and have been fighting kidney failure since my diagnosis in 2005. My health has deteriorated to the stage where I am now in a desperate need of a kidney donor for my kidney transplant. This transplant will allow me to live and see my kids marry and play with grandkids.

If you or someone is willing to consider a kidney donation, you’d be saving my life - hope someone out there can help. Please reach out to 914-468-4191 or [Radhea2002@yahoo.com](mailto:Radhea2002@yahoo.com) and can discuss all details.

I'm **Blood Type O,** so anyone with type O (+ or -) can donate to me directly and if you're not type O, you can donate on my behalf in a paired exchange where you donate to a matching recipient and I receive one from another donor matching mine. This helps both recipients and in some cases a larger group in a donor chain. Donors can be from anywhere in the US.

Just a few quick notes / FAQs:

* The procedure has been in practice for a very long time, causes no long term disadvantage to donor’s health in most cases , whilst allowing you to save the life of another person.
* The cost of your evaluation and surgery will be covered by my insurance. The hospital can give you extensive information on this.
* Donor’s testing/ travel expenses and lost wages are covered by various programs.
* You will have a separate team of healthcare professionals to evaluate you as a living donor. Their job is to help you understand the risks and benefits and look out for your best interests.",1701109471,68,https://www.reddit.com/r/Delaware/comments/1859r9k/urgent_request_need_kidney_donor/,14,ComplexNo7324,,,Health,59,153.3

Delaware,1ge2bpb,I watched the recording of Monique Johns requesting funding for her private party,"... and it was even more farcical than all the [recent posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Delaware/comments/1gcide1/monique_johns_request/) described it ([see the recording here](https://nccde.new.swagit.com/videos/318348), starting at the 1 hr 10 min mark).

Here were the highlights:

* Monique Johns, introducing herself as President-elect of the NCC Council, requested that the NCC Finance Committee allocate $1250 of remaining funds from the *current* President's budget for a 100-person, swearing-in ceremony and reception just for her, since she is not available at the time of the Council's scheduled swearing in. She framed the request as a courtesy, as """"my team is preparing for us to move into this position"""" and because """"the community is very excited about this new position, they're excited for me, as well, and they want to participate.""""
* When the Council chair noted that her [funding proposal](https://imgur.com/a/L4ofOQD) indicates a 50% deposit, 30 days in advance, noting """"you won't have been elected"""" within this timeframe, Monique Johns responded that she already reached out to the caterer to put down the deposit herself. She also stated that she reached out to Council staff to request a separate ceremony.
* After Council members pushed Monique Johns on the fact that she is not yet President-elect (since there's still a general election) -- and that her request for funding felt """"premature"""" -- she dug in by saying that """"no one's called me"""" about when the swearing in would take place, which is why she is making the funding request """"before I take the role."""" The Chair responded that no elected official will be told when the swearing in will take place until after they are elected.
* Monique Johns's opponent, Melissa Brayman, was ***in the room*** when all this went down. Melissa came up for public comment, asserted that she is the other candidate in the race, and noted that, if elected, she would make herself available for *any* predetermined swearing in celebration that is held, whenever that may be.
* After Melissa Brayman finished her comment, the Council immediately and unanimously moved to adjourn, at which one Council member asked, """"So, now can we say, eat cake?""""

You can't make this stuff up. 😂",1730122868,106,https://www.reddit.com/r/Delaware/comments/1ge2bpb/i_watched_the_recording_of_monique_johns/,51,3NU,,,Health,59,153.3

Delaware,1fh3rjd,I got out over my skis,"My company (around 800 employees) is 100% remote, we have pockets of folks all over and a few WeWorks here and there but since the pandemic we shut down the one or two official offices. But as all companies are these days (so it seems) we're _incorporated_ right here in DE.

Long story short my CEO is coming in in a few weeks for some administrative in-person stuff in court. Just for kicks after he mentioned it in an all hands call (he didn't say where but I've seen our filings, I know """"court"""" meant Wilmington) I DM'd him, thanked him for the work he did turning the company around, and offered, as the only employee living in DE, to buy him lunch after his court date. (I have met him maybe once before but he at least knows who I am, he called out some work I did a few months back on another all hands.) _He said yes_ to my complete surprise.

So now...I'm trying to figure out where to get sandwiches that isn't like overly fancy (so not like Harry's Savoy) but also not greasy spoon (so probably not Lucky's either, much as I like their stuff and maybe that _wouldn't_ be the worst idea?). Being around the riverfront or maybe on 202, right off 95, is probably best, I don't want to have him drive all over New Castle County. Trolley Square maybe?

I always take Route 9 home from work, it's just a lot more convenient and quieter than hopping on Route 1.  

The past few weeks, I've encountered a beat-up Oldsmobile that drives up and down Route 9 starting around Townsend up to about the Augustine Beach area in Middletown.  

On more than one occasion, I'll pass this vehicle going in the opposite direction.  Then, about fifteen minutes later, the same vehicle begins closely tailgating me and mirroring my turns until I reach the Middletown area.   The vehicle then peels off past me.  After another few minutes, I'll pass the same driver going back in the opposite direction he was originally going.  

Can't really make the driver's appearance out other than long hair.  Again, not looking to indict anybody as what he's doing is not illegal AFAIK, but it's rather unsettling considering that it's happened several times.

Florida,1fzipfg,"I evacuated, checked into a shelter, minimal lines.","First off, the shelter because people want to make it into a TikTok event said no photos and no filming because people were being filmed without their consent and also being a jerk.

They said if you get caught doing that the police can confiscate your phone. 

That being said....

Short line to check in, had ID, cat license and dog license and their vaccination records. Filled out the emergency contact information form and all of that good stuff.

Got an Uber ride since my car is safe in covered parking garage.

Since I like to do primitive tent camping (no electricity hookups) I basically brought all of my camping gear except for the tent lol. Food water for me and the critters, flashlights radios battery banks etc. a sleeping bag a pillow and an air mattress. Of course change of clothes, I didn't bring my entire condo but you know those great big military roll out bags. 

Some people drove there and brought suitcases of stuff, almost an entire house for two people.... You don't need to bring your entire house with you.

I brought medication and copies of prescriptions and have all of my important documents and medicines in waterproof containers.

They have some cots for disabled and elderly people.

The problem is the transplants...

Some came with absolutely nothing and are basically complaining about everything expecting a high school gym to be like the Hyatt Regency or the Marriott, complaining that they are watching local news and they want to watch Fox News. 

If you can't evacuate, counties are running school buses and city buses and using Uber and Lyft to get people to and from shelters after the storm for free. 

It's not going to be the Holiday Inn but depending where you live it will be safer than your home even with babies crying and sleeping on a floor. 

And if you were going to go to a shelter, they are non-smoking we had people complain that they can't smoke cigarettes there and no you can't bring booze either. 

Treat it as a civil emergency and not a vacation, it's not the Holiday Inn, it's a high school gym.

* On Thursday — just a day after the school shooting — Gainesville police said a [**14-year-old faces charges of terroristic threats and disruption of the operation of a public school.**](https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/2024/09/05/hall-county-teen-arrested-charged-with-making-terroristic-threats-police-say/) The teen is being held in a regional youth detention center.

* Two other teenagers were arrested in Hall County for online threats. Jaymon Alan Justice, 17, was charged as an adult with terroristic threats and disruption or interference with operation of public schools. A 13-year-old boy was also charged with terroristic threats and acts and disruption or interference with operation of public schools. Justice was taken to the Hall County Jail. The 13-year-old was taken to the regional youth detention center in Gainesville.
* Two teens were arrested in two separate threat incidents in Forsyth County. A 15-year-old boy and a 14-year-old boy were charged with terroristic threats. The 14-year-old was also charged with disruption of schools. Both were taken to the regional youth detention center in Gainesville.

* Rome police said 17-year-old Nathaniel Porter Kozelle of Rome was arrested Friday and booked into the Floyd County Jail on charges of terroristic threats and acts, and disrupting the operations of a public school, school bus, or school bus stop. Police said Kozelle is suspected of making “threats of violence,” which led to schools within the Rome City School System going on lockdown for hours. Police said the threats had been “discovered and shared with school system administrators” before police arrested Kozelle at his home. Kozelle was not at school during the lockdowns, according to police.

Georgia,1choe94,Keeping my head above water in Atlanta,"I’m sharing this in the hope that someone else can relate to this experience. I came to Atlanta in July of 2023, fresh from college and trying to escape a small town that, to put it lightly, sucked. I thought that life in a new city that was still close to home would’ve been great but almost a year later, the experience has been pretty dismal.

For starters, riding MARTA has been a mess with its whole host of problems(the hours are crazy, the amount of people that have hassled me and once even tried to start an altercation with me just to get through the gates,etc.) but driving has proven to be just as crazy if not worst. Quick side note: the longer I’ve been in Atlanta, the more I wish I could be in a walkable city instead! Not only is the traffic insane but I got into a minor accident on Ponce, couldn’t find anywhere to pull over right away, and in addition to getting a ticket had to deal with a belligerent driver who tried to accuse me of a hit and run and is now pushing a bullshit injury claim as well as a cop with attitude(who arrived two hours after the fact).

Which is another thing! The ATL cops(& security officers) that I’ve encountered are always so quick to catch an attitude with everyone, always giving off the air of not wanting to actually do their jobs. It’s like all the compassion and humanity left them a long time ago.

Then there’s the people. This one has really hurt me: growing up as a young black man in a predominantly white area I thought moving to a city with so many members of my community would be great but it hasn’t been. So many people I’ve met here are either insanely apathetic or just quick to anger. I’ve struggled to feel any sort of sense of community with the other black people here, it’s a very dog-eat-dog type of city and no one really has any kindness to spare.

Now, that being said, I didn’t fully do my research into the ins and outs of ATL. I just knew that it would be a good place for the profession I’m currently trying to make a career in. However, having lived here now for a time, I don’t want to choose my career over my happiness. I want to live someplace that will feel like home, that I can build a community with others.

Atlanta just hasn’t felt like that and honestly I may give it a few more months but this isn’t a place I’d call home.

This was by no means an eloquently worded post but I hope I got my point across well enough. If anyone else out there is feeling this way, please let me know

EDIT:  I didn't think this post was going to reach as many folks as it did but hey, I've been wrong before. There's no other way to spin it, this post is just one long, long rant that came at a tumultuous point during a not-so-great year. I was feeling some type of way and this is the result of all that. I'm from a small town in South Carolina and this last year has been a rollercoaster. From a physical altercation with another guy at a Marta station to the aforementioned accident as well as a bunch of other stuff, it's been quite the adjustment and a ton of that adjusting has left me pretty damn bitter at this moment in time. What I didn't convey properly when I first posted this is that efforts have been made to improve my situation here: I've got a great job and have made friends with a lot of my co-workers, I've gone out to different bars across the city. I've met some great people here and I can't say that each and every single experience has been a bad one. It still doesn't feel like home yet and I don't even know if I'm going to stay here for the next few months or another year, but I'll take my time and decide. To those who have offered solutions to help me better navigate life in Atlanta as well as those who have taken the time to reach out and commiserate with me, thank you, I really appreciate you guys. To the ones saying to toughen up or get some thick skin, I'm sure you meant that as some sort of helpful advice but that just wasn't it.

Georgia,1gfchyg,"Took a Stand for Kamala in My Rural, Right-Leaning Community – Hoping for Support","
Hey Georgia,

I recently did something that’s been on my mind for a while, but it took a lot of courage to actually follow through on it. As a progressive living in a rural, right-leaning part of Georgia, it often feels like I'm in the minority when it comes to politics. But I believe in Kamala Harris and the direction I think she can help steer our country, so I decided to take a stand.

I was interviewed by CBS Evening News about my choice and the “quiet voters” in our community who also support Harris and plan to vote blue. It was an emotional experience sharing my views so publicly, especially in a town where support for this might not be widespread. There’s a lot of concern on my end about how people around me will react, and honestly, it’s been a nerve-wracking few days since.

Posting here because I could use a little encouragement from people who understand. Standing up for what I believe in feels right, but at the same time, it’s isolating knowing there could be backlash in my community. If any of you have been in similar situations, I'd love to hear your stories. Thanks for listening, and for any support you can send my way.",1730255649,6180,https://x.com/cbseveningnews/status/1851403501995163827?s=46,1003,tifflee17,,,Health,245.3,910.6

Hawaii,1gfutot,How does this sort out for Hawaii in years to come,"Big Trends:

1) Cost of living in Hawaii soaring esp housing making it increasingly unaffordable for all but the most well paid or those who inherit property 

2) Local salaries not keeping pace with either the mainland or Hawaii COL

3) increasing wealth disparities as those with high net worth from around the world move here

4) those who are not yet high income but are skilled and hard working increasingly move away to the mainland to find lower COL and better pay leaving behind those who cant move or are not skilled . This includes a growing population of unemployed, disabled etc

5) small businesses fail due to increasing costs like rent and insurance 

I don't see how over time this doesn't continue to seriously erode the quality of life for everyone here. Services will degrade, businesses will shut down, rich and poor gap will grow, 

  
Am i wrong?

Hawaii,1c462en,The Aloha Spirit is real and awesome,"As you might have guessed, this is sort of in response to the crosspost from another sub that has gone viral today. The thread got locked, but I wanted to share my experience anyway.

I'm a haole and have lived on Oahu for the past half decade with my wife (also haole, though was born and raised here) and my kids. I have to say, though I've personally heard a couple of unpleasant things said about my race around me, the VAST majority of my time spent around locals has been positive. I've felt welcomed, respected, and had a bunch of fun around many folks whose family has been around here for generations. My son's two best friends at preschool are part Hawaiian. Some of my neighbors are part Hawaiian, and they've hosted the block's best Halloween attractions (and f\*reworks displays, but don't tell anybody, lol).

I just went to a 1st birthday in Waimanalo, deep in homestead territory. I wasn't even a guest but a hired hand for the entertainment. Everyone was generous, happy, and helpful. I had to get food for the performers and the caterer made a bunch of to-go plates without hesitation. I was pushing gear and random dudes were helping me get the cart rolled to our van. People were telling me to help myself to soft serve in between performances. I DID NOT KNOW THESE PEOPLE, and they were often going out of their way to make my job easier.

I don't have anything profound to say, but I do think the lens you use to view things has an affect on whether you enjoy your experience. Every community will have some folks who would rather be bitter about their situation and take it out on someone else. Most people I've met in Hawaii, though, would rather make a friend than an enemy regardless of the interaction.",1713133386,378,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hawaii/comments/1c462en/the_aloha_spirit_is_real_and_awesome/,62,HonoluluSolo,,,Economy and Finance,97,228

I'm legitimately considering quitting my job (because working less than 40 hours isn't optional here) and getting a more part time gig so I can make less than the $1990 required for medicaid.

I charge my tesla but according to the app, i've used 312 kwh in the past 31 days.



I called HECO and they said the meter is accurate and there is nothing else they could do. But I feel like something is wrong. $900 for two people is really high. 

My daily average KWH is from 62kwh - 69 kwh



Does the bill sound about right?

Hawaii,1fat7mp,Weird question about Aloha,"So I was recently going through the interview process with a job in Honolulu. I want to add right away that I'm from the mainland USA, and I've never been to Hawai'i. During the interview/recruitment process, the folks from the office I was talking to would always start and end their emails with """"Aloha"""" and """"Mahalo"""". I have to be honest... I wasn't sure if I was supposed to say aloha and mahalo back when replying to them. I felt like it would be not correct of me to use terms and language of a culture that I have never experienced or have had the opportunity to understand firsthand for myself. But I also did not want to seem like I was being disrespectful by not reciprocating the language.

I ended up just sticking to """"Good morning"""" """"Hello"""" and """"Take care!"""". This really got me thinking about the whole situation. So I was wondering- what do you guys think about this? Should I have used aloha here? Would it have been not right for me to have done so? Am I just being weird about this? Just curious.

edit: Thank you everyone for your replies! I'm still unsure if I will get this job, but I appreciate you all taking the time to share your thoughts about this. Even if I don't end up on the islands, this was a great learning experience :)

>The Hawai'i MOA does not require public reporting of any opioid settlement expenditures and does not include any enforcement provisions for addressing the misuse of funds.

This is really messed up. Hawaii's state government is receiving $millions from these settlements and could be spending the money however the government wants with no voice from the people. It pissed me off enough to email my state senator and representative for the first time.

However you lean, left/right/center/whatever, you should be in favor of government transparency and accountability to citizens. It's one of the basic principles of democracy. How can we vote for/against someone if we don't know how they are spending our money?

Hawaii,18cneiv,Finally a chance to help reduce private investors from owning single family homes in Hawai'i,"Proposed bill: End Hedge Fund Control of American Homes Act of 2023

Link moved:

https://adamsmith.house.gov/_cache/files/4/e/4e6f30ad-c8f0-438d-9b6f-99f4093b1162/57491D49DB8A7DE1F076D17C08DB4F2F.2023-end-hedge-fund-control-of-american-homes-act.pdf

Would really benefit places where there are a lot of investors in the private real estate market like Hawai'i.

>Democrats in Congress have introduced a bill in both houses of Congress on Tuesday to ban hedge funds from buying and owning single-family homes in the United States.

>The bill would require hedge funds, defined as corporations, partnerships or real estate investment trusts that manage funds pooled from investors, to sell off all the single-family homes they own over a 10-year period, and eventually prohibit such companies from owning any single-family homes at all. During the decade-long phaseout period, the bill would impose stiff tax penalties, with the proceeds reserved for down-payment assistance for individuals looking to buy homes from corporate owners.

Express your support to your congress reps and ask if there is anything you can do to move it forward.

Raised on section 8 , Wicc, foodstamps, welfare , the whole nine yards. Not saying having any of those are bad but.. you already know what situation you’re in if you have any of those ..As a young adult in Hawaii, especially in 2024, I feel like it’s harder to stay here unless you’ve got the privilege of generational housing or you lose an arm, leg while making a salary of $300k. What makes living here harder is of course the jobs as well. As much as I hate to say it but you’re not getting an amazing job in hawaii unless 1. You know someone 2. Have 12 years of experience right of high school 3. Your family owns a business or 4. You’re from out of state that got relocated. 10 more years from now and the new term of local is gonna look different.

Idaho,1blvlid,"I’m Rick Just, writer, history buff, and Idaho State Senator. Ask me anything about Idaho, myself, and what’s been happening in the Idaho legislature. Today Sat 3/23/24 10am-1pm MTN","Hi [r/Idaho](https://www.reddit.com/r/Idaho/)! My name is Rick, and I'm here to answer any questions you might have about my life, my career, and the Idaho legislature.

A bit about me:

My great great grandparents (on both sides) came to Idaho in 1863, a few weeks after it became a territory. I grew up on a ranch, part of the family homestead, along the Blackfoot River in Eastern Idaho.

For several years I worked in radio, mostly in Idaho, but with stints in Wyoming and North Carolina. I spent a couple of years in the Marine Corps at Marine Corps Air Station New River, which is near Camp Lejeune. I have a BA in English and a Masters of Public Administration from Boise State University. While my wife Rinda got her law degree from the University of Washington I worked for a West Coast publishing company.

During my 30-year career with the Idaho Department of Parks and Recreation (our state parks agency) I served as the public information officer and later the chief of planning.

I’ve written 13 books, both fiction and nonfiction. Most of my books nowadays are about Idaho history. I publish a daily blog called Speaking of Idaho on Facebook, and write a weekly Idaho history column for Boise Weekly.

Now, I'm excited to answer any questions you may have! Ask away!

**Suggestions for questions:**

What are you working on in the legislature this year?

What do you do for fun?

What do you care about the most?

What are you most proud of in your life?

Lastly, I wouldn't be a proper politician unless I asked. I am currently seeking donations.  [A donation of $100, $50, $20, $10 or whatever you are able to give, will be a big help.](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/committee-to-elect-rick-just-1)

Edit 2:  

As we finish up, I just want to say thank you to the moderators and community you all have built here. I believe that a path forward for Idaho involves candid conversations that bring us together, like this one. I am so impressed by the questions posed. Every time I talk to people from Idaho it proves that many of us are worried about the big issues (property taxes, healthcare, public education, civil liberties, and extremism) and not what our legislature has been doing. As my work continues this session, your questions and comments will go with me. Thank you for being involved.

Idaho,1en223y,TL;DR: Vote yes on the Idaho Top-Four Ranked-Choice Voting Initiative in November.,"Strap in because this is a long one.

It's no secret that there's an election coming up in November. No matter who you are or who you're voting for, it's important that you register and vote to make sure that your voice is heard in this democracy. This doesn't just go for the presidential election. There are open seats in various levels of government that you need to be voting on too. (This is true pretty much every year, so even when it's not a presidential election it's extremely important to get out and vote.)



For those in Idaho, I’d argue that the single most important thing you can vote on this year is the Idaho Top-Four Ranked-Choice Voting Initiative. This initiative will improve the election system in Idaho by doing two things: 1) it will secure open primaries in the state of Idaho, and 2) it will establish a ranked-choice voting (RCV) system.



These two things are unequivocally massive improvements to the current system, RCV especially. With RCV, each voter will be able to select the candidates for each position by ranking them in order of preference. When the votes are tallied, they begin by tallying up the first choices on each ballot. If there is no clear winner, they will remove the person with the least votes and tally the second choice of those who ranked that candidate first. This process continues until a clear winner is selected.



This process has several notable benefits:

1. Voters no longer feel the need to vote for a candidate they don't like simply because they like the other guy less. This leads to more people voting for their actual preferred candidate and has the effect of also cutting down on the need for """"strategic voting"""".

2. Independent and third party candidates are no longer (as) systemically overlooked. It's far more likely a third party candidate will get to a solid number of votes in this system. This frees the voters from the two party system that we have been locked into and once again cuts down on the need to vote for the """"lesser of two evils"""".

3. Nobody can be considered as """"throwing away their vote"""" under this system. Of course, as candidates are eliminated, some people may have their ballots exhausted and none of their choices tallied in the final count, but this is far less likely than in the current system. As it stands now, voting for any candidate other than the Republican or Democratic nominee means that, mathematically speaking, your vote automatically doesn't matter. This is far less of a problem under RCV.

4. All of these benefits together mean one additional thing: fewer apathetic voters, and a higher voter turnout. When people feel their vote counts, they tend to actually want to vote. Under the current system, many don't feel like their vote actually counts, but that can easily change by implementing RCV.



There are a few counterpoints to RCV that I have heard, and I'll list those and my rebuttal to them.

1. This will confuse voters, and cause anxiety and mass confusion at the ballot box. The rebuttal is simple: education. Already in our current system there are many helpful volunteers at the voting locations that are ready and able to help with any questions or concerns one may have. There are clear instructions written on every ballot. This would not change. On top of that, state and local officials can step in to help educate the public on how it works before the elections, and schools can explain it to the high schoolers and college students soon to be able to vote.

2. Elections are supposed to be one person, one vote. Rebuttal: Yes. They are, and this doesn't change that. At the end of the day, each person's vote is tallied exactly once in the final count (with the rare exception that all of their selections are exhausted, in which case their selections wouldn't have won to begin with).

3. RCV benefits those with more time and information. Rebuttal: while this is true, it is also true of the current system in most cases too. Similar to the first point however, the answer is education. Letting people know sources to find information on each candidate quickly and easily will give everyone that same benefit. At the end of the day, voters can still put the candidate from their preferred party at the top and call it a day.

4. RCV will give an unfair advantage to \[insert party\]. Reworded by Rep. Lance Clow """"Their goal is to give the Idaho Democrat Party an increased opportunity to gain traction in Idaho..."""" Rebuttal: This one is funny to me. If you think that RCV will give traction or an advantage to any one party, ask yourself why it would do that. The answer: RCV gives more people a voice. When more people have a voice, and a particular party or candidate becomes more popular, that means that candidate or party was already popular. If more people want that candidate, then let the will of the people decide that. I will betray here that I do not support the republican party in the slightest, but when more people in Idaho inevitably vote red, I accept that because I believe in democracy.

5. Bonus 5th argument from Rep. Lance Clow: """"I’ve never heard any citizen ask for top-four primaries or Ranked Choice Voting."""" This is also funny to me because it's objectively not true anymore. First, he's not my representative, but I have been writing my representatives about these for the last two years. Second, this petition exists and got nearly 100,000 signatures. That means that there have been citizens asking for these things.



I will say that I'm not well versed in the benefits and detriments of open primaries enough to spread information about how it will affect elections, but it is my opinion based on what I do know that this will be a net positive. The following sources have more information on this particular issue:

[https://yesforopenprimaries.com/open-primaries-initiative](https://yesforopenprimaries.com/open-primaries-initiative)

[https://www.reclaimidaho.org/](https://www.reclaimidaho.org/)

[https://ballotpedia.org/Arguments\_for\_and\_against\_closed\_primaries](https://ballotpedia.org/Arguments_for_and_against_closed_primaries)



Overall, voting in favor of this initiative is the easiest step any Idahoan can make toward more fair and representative elections in the state going forward. It boosts the voice of independent voters, increases voter confidence and turnout, and establishes grounds for more popular and less ideologically extreme candidates. This could be the single most important decision you make regarding the future of your rights, our democracy, and our childrens' futures.

Idaho,1cwmho9,Don't move to Idaho based off of users from this sub,"If you're are considering moving to Idaho a lot of the comments and posts lean towards a certain... side if you know what I mean. This is coming from someone who is in the middle but leans conservative (pro-gun but I wan't higher minimum wage, ect)

I want to strongly let you as a reader a lot of these posts do not reflect the vast majority of the mindset of Idahoans. 

I find it hilarious how any left leaning side type of comment or post gets immediate upvotes, but heaven forbid someone posts something about leaning red/right it totally deserves to be immediately downvoted :|

Because Im calling people out, this post will get downvoted likely. This sub is filled with a certain niche of Idahoans, that in real life you will not see as often.

If you are moving here, most middle class and upper middle class suburbs will have multiple Trump flags, (if there is going to be someone in the comments in complete denial of this, I will personally post a video to prove them wrong. And I mean true middle class like average house price.) Another example is back during 2020 a ton of local Idaho businesses had a blue line flag to support police during the events. You will see AR15 stickers on trucks, cars ect. Just giving you guys a idea.

Most of the left leaning people in Idaho, are in real life, a smaller portion of the Idaho people. Generally speaking, they are younger, college students, and most of them are in Boise and sprinkled in surrounding cities. Boise is basically a mini pre 2020 Portland a this point, and is a mixing pot where if you are left leaning, you will fit in much better (provided you can afford to live there.) Is there a pro biden unicorn group of people up in Idaho City? Yeah probably, but this is not the norm. Your much more likely to run into conservatives everywhere outside Boise.

Another thing, Idaho does have some racists and hate groups but it is not as exaggerated as this sub makes them out to be. Most of them are up way north. 

This post is just a proper reality check for people moving here if your looking at the comments and posts of the subs. 

TAKE WHAT I SAY WITH A GRAIN OF SALT

This said too though, Idaho is lovely because the land is nice and open with nice clear skies. You can go out to BLM (public land not the movement) and shoot guns, ride dirtbikes, have fun ect.

TBH I don't suggest moving to Idaho at this point because the cost of living is way beyond the wages companies can afford to pay. I would highly suggest looking to move to Texas while you can still get a nice new home under 200k just like pre 2016 Idaho, and the wages are way better. This might sound crazy but if cost of living is something you want, East Europe is also a great spot with a conservative background (500 bucks for a good apartment, average income out there is about 800 usd in bigger cities than Boise.)

Ask me anything about politics, policy, running for office, rural organizing, bipartisan leadership, combating rising political violence & aggression, or whatever else you can think of!

I am on my second congressional run, being recruited to run for office while still finishing my degrees in criminal justice and political science. I’ve spent the last two years driving across my 500 mile long district with 19 counties, driving 43,000 miles in 2024 alone. As a working-class mom of two and college student, I built a grassroots movement across Idaho focused on uniting rural communities around sensible policy solutions and against fear-based, divisive rhetoric. 

After discovering how few resources candidates have in Idaho, and how little infrastructure existed in rural communities, we’ve created our own and used our campaign to organize at the local, state, and federal levels. 

Our campaign has been endorsed by Vote Common Good, Vote Mama, the Idaho AFL-CIO, USW 77, and currently works alongside several unions to promote policy reform for everyday working-class families. I’ve done appearances on Meidas Touch, Straight White American Jesus, and Girl & The Gov. 

I am here to discuss what America’s political process really looks like for everyday people, how to combat hyper partisan political messaging, how to protect women’s rights, workers rights, education, voting rights, how we organize forgotten rural communities, and sensible policy solutions that matter to the average American citizen.

Idaho,1fc3d9n,So you want to start a business in smalltown Idaho...,"A veritable flood of semi-retired/retired folks have flooded into my town in the last 18 months, and many of them have started a business. Many of these businesses have failed for the same reason, so I thought maybe it would be helpful if someone who's been watching this game on the sidelines for several years would share their insights.

**Are you Sure?**

When you imagine having your own business, is it doing the work, or having the shop, or imagined social accolades for being a local small business owner? If the dream isn't the work of it, it's probably best to keep this a fantasy.

**The Idea**

I know that many people open the 'business of their dreams' and that they really want to run a coffee shop, or a book store, or a bakery, that they have an idea in mind. And I think having a strong idea that you've designed out in your head is important. 

But. 

I strongly recommend that you spend 6 months in your small town getting out there and talking to people. Participate in local Facebook groups. Join the rotary. Sit in on city council meetings. Donate your time to some sort of universally liked cause like animals. All good ways to find out what the town wants, who they support, and why they support them. Also, being a known value means you will probably get more support than if you just hang out your shingle.

The reality I see is that many of the ideas are informed by city life. While some city trends do eventually make it out to the sticks, some never do. (Boba tea in particular seems to be a huge deal in cities. I do not know what it is, nor have I ever seen it. Someone tried to start a boba tea thing, and it tanked in a week. No one else knew what it was, and no one was that curious either.) Be careful about that.

Other ideas are informed by what fellow retirees want. In general, that's a bit of a problematic demographic for businesses, because of the fixed income and general desire for something that is very often a dying model for a business outside of a very few niche locales.

It is best to stay flexible with your idea by simplifying it. """"I want to run a coffee shop where people can sit down and enjoy the rainy days, and check out boardgames, and linger."""" can turn into """"I want to create a non-alcoholic third space in my town."""" """"I want to run a witchy tarot shop"""" can turn into """"I want to create a space for alternative people in the town."""" """"I want to run a fine dining establishment"""" .... actually, I'll unpack that one in detail.

Fine Dining establishments tank left and right in small towns. If you really dedicate yourself to watching what's going on, you'll see that many restaurants have a """"nice night' several times a year where they serve upmarket food like prime rib, porterhouse steaks, etc. Some places also have a more upscale summer menu and otherwise serve plainer food. The truth is there's simply not enough demand for this type of restaurant in a smaller town. 

*Math: if a dining establishment has only a dozen tables, and let's say they can sit an average of 36 people total, and each table is there for about 2 hours, then if they open at five and close the kitchen at 8 on a weeknight, they need 72 people per evening to be busy. let's say they are only open Thursday through Sunday, and they have a Sunday Brunch service and a Saturday Lunch service which can also serve about 72 people each, so that's 432 diners served per week. Let's say there are 15,000 people in a string of co-located small towns. Let's say 10k of those people are in a position to patronize the restaurant. That's 4% of the available public per week. Every single person in town who could go, would have to go, no less than twice a year to keep the business busy. That's a surprisingly large ask.*

***Stay Flexible with your Idea!***

**Business Hours**

I wasn't really sure where to put this section, but I realized that many people's ideas involve them continuing to work banker's hours. While this can work in touristy spots during the touristy season for that spot, it generally sets people up to fail. There are several stores I'd like to patronize in my town that are open almost exclusively during the hours I, and most everyone else, works. And they close for lunch. 

This could work, again, during touristy season, but in general, shops and restaurants need to be open when people can patronize them. Which is evenings and weekends. If that's not when you want to work, you either need a new idea or you need to hire people. But honestly, if you aren't prepared to work the hours you want to be open, that's going to be a problem, because that's when people will want or need to talk to the owner/manager.

**Skillsets**

Please think about your own skillset and the skillset you need to make the business work. If you haven't managed a retail service business or a restaurant in the last ten years (and especially if you never have) you are going to run into a lot of early problems, and you may run afoul of the law, too. Are you prepared to take classes, work for free at a similar business to learn the ropes, and also have some expensive mistakes? You need to be.

Please also think about the skillsets you need to hire, and more importantly, train. This has been a critical point of failure for many small businesses in my locality. There's a genuine belief that """"anyone"""" can cook/run a register/clean properly. But there's no such thing as an unskilled job. There is unskilled labor (I had to explain how to make change in the last few years) but there is no unskilled job. You can train certain things to an acceptable level of proficiency fairly quickly, but training still needs to happen.

Better skillsets cost more. A lot more than most people imagine. In some cases, they may not be available, and you'll need to go without or do it yourself, or bring someone in who has that skillset and wants a serious change of pace.

A special note on computers and mobile devices. Pretty much every business now has a technology angle. If you do not want to deal with phones or computers, hang it up now. 

**The Staff**

In almost every case, people have to hire some folks for their business. In almost every case I hear the small businesses bitch, moan, whine, and complain about this aspect. This is a problem on many fronts, but let's just talk about staff just now.

1. If your business is open  primarily or just significantly during school hours, it is unlikely to be a job that you can advertise as 'for teenagers.' 
2. Speaking of teenagers, pretty much no one is allowing their kids to work in a kitchen or bar past 11pm, even if it is legal. You will NOT find a 16 year old to run your dishwasher for 8 bucks an hour plus tips on Friday night. It's simply not going to happen. 
3. If your business is open during school pick-up and drop off (we don't necessarily have busses due to funding issues and driver scarcity) it is unlikely you will be able to tap into SAHMs as a resource.
4. For that matter, don't assume that your fellow retirees or transplants want to work.
5. If your business pays less than the average starting wage between the nearest McDonalds and Walmart, you will be unlikely to attract decent labor. Life in small towns used to be cheaper, but it certainly isn't now.
6. If you refuse to hire anyone who isn't squeaky clean, you will struggle to find and keep staff. 
7. If you expect staff to work as hard as you do, you probably aren't ready to run a business. It's not their baby, it's not their profit, and it's not their life. Think about how  hard you worked at your lowest point of productivity and expect that as the bare minimum an employee will do. Be honest about what that looked like.
8. Don't assume that small town values = out dated values. People will absolutely notice if your FOH staff is all cute blonds, and they will talk.
9. Straight wages (no PTO, no benefits) is fine for 20 hours or less each week, but anyone working more needs more. Do better and give it to them.
10. Staff will probably not do the shit job, or if they do, it won't be done the way you want it done. Being the owner tends to mean doing more of the worst work, not less of it.

***Whatever you don't like about staff in the places you've been will also be a problem with the staff you get unless you make a point of being a good place to work.***

**Money**

The biggest question to ask yourself is """"can you afford to fail?""""

If the answer is no, do not start the business. Even in large cities that can support an idea, well over 50% of businesses fail. I'd say that close to 90% of businesses fail in small towns.

If you can't afford to pay staff a living wage, if you can't afford any benefits for full time staff, if you have to work 70 hours a week for free to make things work.... don't start the business.

If you have to take a loan larger than your house value, don't start the business.

***Rescale it, rework the idea, change the hours, etc, etc, etc, until the money works, or don't start the business. You have a much higher than average chance of failing in small town.***

**Don't win at someone else's expense**

My town needed a second-hand shop. We got one. We liked it at first. 

It failed because we all rapidly realized that they were going around to all the charity shops/rummage sales run by the churches, grabbing the good stuff and dramatically marking it up. The  town viewed the shop, quite rightly, as robbing the poorest people in town of the opportunity to have nicer things, and that did not go over all.  

**Accept the Verdict from the Court of Public Opinion with Grace**

Let's go back to the Boba Shop. The owner, when they realized they had no customers,  started a public meltdown in the local FB pages. They were begging people to come try their product. It was not a good look, and, as I recall (though this may not be bang on, since it was a couple years ago and I didn't care that much) someone finally wrote out everything wrong with the business on their posts. They were only open from 9am to 3pm, which realistically meant that more people could only go get their product during lunch. The menu started at ~12 dollars and went up from there, which at the time was equivalent to an hour of work at most businesses. They had set up shop where there was little to no parking nearby, but they also weren't really located in the 'walking district.' At the end of the week they basically told people to 'please come enjoy some free product on me, because I don't really want all this food to rot.' 37 people showed up to try the product for free. I do remember a post in which they kinda chewed out the town for not having more interest in the business, where they shouted that people wouldn't even take it for free.

The town just did not want Boba. Or if they did, not at that price. The owner basically drove themselves out of town with their antics. 

And it was avoidable. As I understood it, people had strongly suggested that they not open the shop, that there was not enough interest. People had strongly suggested that they open during tourist season, because they would get city tourists who would patronize the shop and potentially drive curiosity (because if it's hopping, you might start to wonder why.) People strongly suggested that they do a big free giveaway on their first day or so, or some sort of BOGO deal so people could try to product, since it was novel to most if not all of us. But the owner ignored the court of public opinion at every turn, and that really sunk their ship.

***If the town doesn't like your first idea, if you handle that with grace, they may like your second idea. If you don't handle it with grace, you will probably find yourself iced out of public life. Accept the verdict early and easily.***

**A note on 'theme'**

I can't believe I have to say this, but having a California theme is not going to win you customers. I would suggest no theme at all. But if you must have one, do not have a """"California Beachside"""" theme complete with surfboard and California names for all your products. 

**The Better Idea**

A lot of the ideas I hear from recently arrived persons are very *aesthetic* when small towns really need *basics*.  If you were a mechanic, plumber, contractor, esthetician, childcare specialist, teacher, CDL, machinist, welder, appliance repairman, nurse, doctor, vet, or many of these other types of jobs, consider setting up shop as a part-timer, or joining an outfit as a part-timer. Very often having these types of skills will allow you to set your own hours, and people will tolerate having some over none.",1725816889,271,https://www.reddit.com/r/Idaho/comments/1fc3d9n/so_you_want_to_start_a_business_in_smalltown_idaho/,71,Peliquin,,,Health,175.6,316.3

Idaho,1cy63bn,Idaho Legislature Primary Election Results - How did IFF-endorsed candidates do?,"The IFF and its Idaho Freedom PAC has unfortunately become a huge power broker in Idaho politics, and its endorsement and """"freedom index"""" carries a lot of weight, especially in Republican primaries. Many of the more mainstream Republicans faced primary challenges from IFF-endorsed candidates across the state, with a lot of tightly contested battles. So, I cross-referenced the Idaho Freedom PAC's endorsement list with last night's election results, and wanted to share some of that information with you.

Overall, the **IFF-endorsed candidates won 19 of the 39 contested primaries** in which they were involved, or **49%**. While this may seem promising given that most didn't manage to win, it should be noted that a lot of the races they did win managed to overcome more moderate incumbents. Also, their losses were heavily concentrated in Eastern Idaho, which is notably more moderate than the Northern region of the state, as well as now the Southwest.

**IFF-endorsed primary challengers unseated 10 incumbents**: Schroeder, (Matthew) Bundy, Blanksma, Yamamoto, Wroten, Winder, Durrant, (Chenele) Dixon, Hartgen, and Lanting. Notably, Blanksma and Winder have been elected as legislature leadership in recent years, but have now fallen out of favor with the further right wing of the party. Also, the IFF-endorsed candidates swept District 8 against incumbents, which seems to indicate that the far right wing of the party is growing its influence significantly beyond the Northern area of the state.

On the other hand, **4 IFF-endorsed incumbents were unseated**: Herndon, Gallagher, Lambert, and Julianne Young. I should note, however, that Young's race was decided by 10 votes and is likely to see a recount. Certainly, this means that the spread of the IFF's influence is not unanimous and is starting to see some blowback, even in District 1. Maybe some voters are growing tired of these far right candidates, but it seems they will continue grow in popularity before they decline.

All this said, one way to reduce the spread of the IFF and their preferred candidates is to vote for the Open Primaries Initiative this November. Open primaries and ranked-choice voting prioritize consensus governance and serious candidates who appeal to a broad majority of voters, rather than a slim majority of one party's most extreme wing. If that passes, maybe we can stem the tide of extremism in our state.",1716399140,103,https://www.reddit.com/r/Idaho/comments/1cy63bn/idaho_legislature_primary_election_results_how/,67,deleted,,,Health,175.6,316.3

Idaho,1dkmo9w,Illegal shooting of Birds of Prey.,"About 5 or 6 months back, I was out at the Pickle Butte shooting range in Nampa. On my way out there, I noticed an F150 driving incredibly slow on the main road outta there. As I passed him I watched in my rearview mirror. He rolls his window down, put the barrel of his rifle out the window, and shoots a Peregrine Falcon nesting at the top of a power pylon. As I realized what had happened, I flipped a bitch and started hauling ass towards him. By that time he was out of his truck already and had thrown the bird in his bed. He high tails it outta there, I tried following but he was starting to drive recklessly. As anybody knows, those roads are pretty windy at times. So I let off and called Fish and Game. The feathers and the small puddle of blood was enough for the Fish and Game guy to say that they are going to start patrolling those roadways. I am a second amendment following American. The second I see some stupid shit like that, my blood starts to boil. He knew he was wrong, and he knew he would have been FUCKED if I caught up to him.

Idaho,1b7qull,On loving Idaho,"Long time lurker, first time poster. I’ve lived in this state my entire 30 years. In that time, I’ve been a lot of places, and nothing comes close to comparing to this beautiful state. That being said, in this day and age, the “us vs. them” mentality has never been louder, and frankly, it makes me fucking sick and frustrated. I get that both sides have really strong opinions and while I do feel that some are overall better than others, really what it comes down to is empathy and a willingness to coexist with each other. And before you write this off as some hippy-dippy bullshit, I just want to ask how exhausting is it to be angry all the time? Because I know I’m sick of it.

Illinois,1eqhu8p,The government spends millions in food deserts to open grocery stores. Why aren't they surviving?,">Emerging stores struggle for many reasons. Food deserts are, by definition, areas with depressed economies and often declining populations, but certain problems repeatedly bubble to the top.

>“The main concern with them is prices,” said Dossie, explaining why some Cairo residents haven’t done much shopping at Rise. The 32-year-old mother of five was unemployed before she became one of the store’s first employees. She shops there to support Rise and because she doesn’t have a car, but she wishes it could offer discounts like chain grocers. “I know, me personally, I have a big family and I need to be able to get bulk for a cheaper amount.”

>Her concerns are backed up by an emerging body of academic research suggesting that the conventional wisdom about how to overcome food deserts — building stores in underserved areas — overlooks the fact that prices matter as much as proximity. For all the benefits the opening of a store can bring to a community, if it can’t compete on pricing, it will struggle to survive.

[https://www.stlpr.org/government-politics-issues/2024-08-12/food-desert-grocery-store-cairo-illinois](https://www.stlpr.org/government-politics-issues/2024-08-12/food-desert-grocery-store-cairo-illinois)

The article highlights the troubles at Cairo's grocery store, which opened a year ago.  But the problems which threaten its survival is a familiar one. Independent grocery stores, even small chains, have trouble meeting the prices of large chains.  And customers will drive miles out of their way for lower prices, making it hard for the small stores to survive.",1723479181,268,https://www.reddit.com/r/illinois/comments/1eqhu8p/the_government_spends_millions_in_food_deserts_to/,103,imlostintransition,,,Defense and National Security,137.3,609.3

I think she did so because I got my 18 year old son out to vote for the first time.  The workers were calling out first time voters and they would cheer for them.  Pretty cool.  It was about every 5 minutes they were cheering.  Kind of neat to see, but probably skewed since its IU's fall break right now.  Gives hope for the future though!

Indiana,1cehmug,Indiana is looking to significantly reduce academic requirements to get a High school diploma,"I did a search, and was surprised not to see this posted.

For kids grades 7th and below, starting with the class of 2029, Indiana is basically reducing the academic rigor required to earn a high school diploma, and making it more work-based. Big issue is that you can earn a high school diploma from Indiana and not have the requirements to apply to college. They are reducing math requirements to algebra I, no world languages, no world history, requiring computer science (!!) of all things, and adding a bunch of extra non-academic things for parents to track in order to graduate high school, which I'll be honest I am not interested in doing.  If I wanted to pursue an alternative education for my child, I would have. I don't want to get this from public school.

Here is a video that Lake Central did to summarize the changes.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xv6C-blq3pE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xv6C-blq3pE)

Here is a link to provide feedback on how poorly this is being executed, and how it does not much to progress the state of Indiana.

Indiana,1cvcbpr,FSSA getting sued by the ACLU,"Due to Indiana's alleged $900M shortfall last year, Indiana's Family and Social Services Administration (FSSA) has determined that this is the result of parent caregivers of medically complex children and are attempting to eliminate the program this July 1st. This was announced only a few months ago.

The ACLU has reviewed this and has determined many laws, statutes, mandates, etc. have been broken and are seeking an injunction. I'm hopeful the DOJ will get involved to not only force the State what they are legally obligated to do, but to investigate the missing and/or overspent $900M in just last year alone.

This will be an interesting case since many other states are trying or have moved funds out of these programs to serve their other interests.

Here are just a few things I found about him:

-Opposes same sex marriage (in 2024?? even trump has softened his stance on this..)

-Opposes student loan forgiveness (but for a horrible reason: because it makes military recruitment harder…)

-Despite not being able to come up with a better alternative, he opposes the ACA

-Voted against bipartisan COVID stimulation

-Voted, even after the Capitol attack, to still object to the certification of Biden’s victory

-Opposes environmental action (even Braun knows climate change is serious…)

-Constantly uses divisive “but le leftist propagandists!!1!” dogwhistles 

-Prominent conspiracy theorist

Really the only good thing about him is that he knows we need to stand up against our foreign opponents in the Iranian, Hamas and Russian regimes.

[Destination Iowa Grants](https://www.iowaeda.com/destination-iowa-federal/) are federally funded awards made available through the American Rescue Plan Act, which President Joe Biden signed into law and Reynolds attacked during her re-election campaign in 2021. The Act was the biggest legislative win in the first year of Biden’s administration.

None of the 21 other Republican Governors — including those who opposed Biden’s plan –refused the aid.

Iowa,1ellldy,Taking a look at our neighbors to the north: Public Education,"Now that Walz has been selected as Harris' Vice Presidential candidate, I thought it would be interesting to compare the policy surrounding public education in our state compared to Minnesota, our neighbors to the north.

I want to make a few notes for the comments that will inevitably populate this thread:

* """"If you don't like it leave"""" or variations. I have lived in Iowa my entire life. I love this state. I will try my hardest to make the state I love better.
* We don't want Iowa to be like California. Great news, this is about Minnesota. A state directly comparable to ours and really close, actually.

Anyways, on to the main topic of the post.

  
**ELECTORAL BACKGROUND**

Iowa is similar historically to Minnesota. Iowa has drifted to the right recently, with a supermajority in the Iowa Senate and nearly a supermajority in the Iowa House. However, it wasn't too many years ago, these were split. Minnesota, by contrast, has a Democratic majority by one seat in the senate and a few seat majority in the house, with a Democratic governor.

  
All of this is just a bit of background to illustrate the thin margins in the Minnesota legislature and what was able to be accomplished. Iowa Republicans, if they wanted to replicate these accomplishments (sorry for those who like the suspense, they don't), they have much more wiggle room with their large majorities.

  
**FEEDING STUDENTS**

In 2023, Minnesota passed a bill providing free lunches[ to every student](https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/minnesota-house-to-approve-universal-school-meals/) in Minnesota.

>The federal government pays for free or reduced priced meals but there are income limits for who qualifies. Under this bill, the state would pick up the tab for the difference of covering everyone else, which is estimated to be $388 million in the next two-year budget. 

This bill is picked up by the state, not by individual school districts. 

[>“This is a good problem to have,” Walz said when asked about the increased cost Wednesday. “It also should be a wakeup call. We’ve got a lot of folks out there that may be food insecure more so than we thought.”](https://minnesotareformer.com/2024/01/10/walz-celebrates-first-months-of-universal-free-school-meals/)

The program is getting more participation than expected. Walz says free meals are a necessity. Kids aren't charged for water or electricity costs for the district, for example.

  
Meanwhile, in Iowa. [Gov. Reynolds turned down federal funding to feed children.](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/columnists/iowa-view/2024/08/06/iowa-kim-reynolds-summer-ebt-2025-grocery-assistance-deadline/74683577007/)

>Months ago the governor [declined $29 million in federal support](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2023/12/22/iowa-opts-out-of-ebt-food-program-for-low-income-children-in-summer-eb-usda/72015276007/) that would have provided funds for parents to buy food in Iowa grocery stores and feed their children over the summer break. Without that funding, hardworking families struggling to make ends meet in a tough economy are forced to visit food pantries or tragically go without.

Iowa has the opportunity to apply for EBT until August 15th.

>37% of all Iowa households don’t make enough to cover the cost of basic needs. 15.4% of Iowa children are food insecure. And last year, 42% of Iowa’s kids relied on the National Free Lunch Program to meet their nutritional needs Monday through Friday.

Iowa students still need to pay for school lunches if they do not meet the federal requirements for free or reduced lunch.

  
**EDUCATION FUNDING**

Since 2017, per pupil funding has dropped [$899](https://www.bleedingheartland.com/2024/06/18/the-idiot-lights-are-flashing/). This amounts to about $600 million in lost funding for Iowa schools. 

>During the 2024 session, the legislature increased the per pupil state funding for K-12 schools ([called Supplemental State Aid](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/publications/BF/13835.pdf)) by just 2.5 percent for fiscal year 2025, which begins on July 1. That will likely cause the cost per pupil to fall further behind the rate of inflation. 

Vouchers will also take [money out of Iowa public schools](https://iowastartingline.com/2024/04/24/iowa-sets-aside-almost-180-million-for-year-two-of-voucher-program/)

>Another big change for the upcoming 2024-25 year is that public school districts will directly lose money due to voucher program. 

>State funding for public schools is primarily based on enrollment weighting and state cost per pupil. Before the voucher law, districts still received those funds from the state even for students who lived in the district but did not attend a public school. Going forward, districts will no longer receive those dollars.

An estimated $180 million of public tax dollars are being allocated to this program.

  
Now back to Minnesota.

[The Minnesota Legislature during the 2023 session passed a sweeping education bill that boosted public spending for schools by nearly $2.3 billion. ](https://minnesotareformer.com/2023/06/02/whats-in-minnesotas-2023-education-bill/)

>The per-pupil formula distribution is based on district enrollment, as well as the district’s student profile. The bill increases the formula by 4% in fiscal year 2024 and 2% in fiscal year 2025. Districts will receive $7,138 per student in fiscal year 2024 — up from the current $6,683 per student. That’s a 6.8% increase. 

They are also tying funding increases to inflation, something Iowa is consistently underfunding on:

>In the years following, the formula will be indexed to inflation, with a minimum annual increase of 2% and a maximum increase of 3%.

Minnesota does not have an ESA voucher program. The two approaches to education are stark in their differences.

**CONCLUSION**

This is a very short overview of a few issues I care about and how they are different in Iowa vs our neighbors to the north in Minnesota. I think this is in no small part a reflection on Walz's career as an educator.

  
I hope our lawmakers, both Democratic and Republican, look to what Minnesota has been able to accomplish and make steps to replicate it.

Iowa,1fr14mp,The case against Iowa 2024 Constitutional Amendment 1,"Just over a month ago, I made a post to r/Iowa about 2024 Constitutional Amendment 1 titled [Democracy is (literally) on the ballot in Iowa this November](https://www.reddit.com/r/Iowa/comments/1epovqa/democracy_is_literally_on_the_ballot_in_iowa_this/). In that time, I've been continuing to read up on the issue, processing feedback, and having conversations with folks here and elsewhere in an effort to make sure I have as accurate a perspective on this topic as possible. I've decided to put the fruits of those labors into this masterpost, which I am committing to updating until election day 2024 if/when new information on this topic is uncovered. This post has links to all referenced supporting materials, and is neatly organized into readable headings (something the previous post was *sorely* lacking). The goal is for this to be the """"one stop shop"""" for anyone that has questions or concerns regarding Amendment 1.

# What is """"Iowa 2024 Constitutional Amendment 1""""?

""""Iowa 2024 Constitutional Amendment 1"""" (or simply """"Amendment 1"""") is how I will be referring to the first of two on-ballot constitutional amendments you will see [on the second page of your ballots](https://web.archive.org/web/20240922222100/https://www.polkcountyiowa.gov/media/uhyi0t0y/des-moines-39.pdf) when you vote this fall. Ballotpedia also refers to this amendment as the """"[Iowa Require Citizenship to Vote in Elections and Allow 17-Year-Olds to Vote in Primaries Amendment (2024)](https://ballotpedia.org/Iowa_Require_Citizenship_to_Vote_in_Elections_and_Allow_17-Year-Olds_to_Vote_in_Primaries_Amendment_(2024)),"""" although this is not its official title.

# What is the current law that Amendment 1 will change?

Amendment 1 would modify Article II (Suffrage), Section 1 (Electors) of [the Iowa constitution](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/publications/ICP/1207142.pdf). The full text of the law as it currently stands is as follows:

>Every citizen of the United States of the age of twenty-one years, who shall have been a resident of this state for such period of time as shall be provided by law and of the county in which he claims his vote for such period of time as shall be provided by law, shall be entitled to vote at all elections which are now or hereafter may be authorized by law. The general assembly may provide by law for different periods of residence in order to vote for various officers or in order to vote in various elections. The required periods of residence shall not exceed six months in this state and sixty days in the county.

To put this in simple language, merely being a U.S. citizen entitles you to a right to vote in state and local elections in Iowa, so long as you also meet the other qualifications below:

* You are at least 21 years old
* You have lived in Iowa for at least 6 months
* You have lived in the county you're registering to vote in for at least 60 days

Because of how this section of the Iowa state constitution is phrased, neither the state of Iowa nor any municipality within it can pass any laws that restrict the voting pool to be *smaller* than what is outlined here. Any laws passed that alter voter eligibility from what is written above must instead expand the voting pool, even hypothetically allowing non-citizens to vote in local elections (although this has never happened in any Iowa locale).

# How would Amendment 1 change current law?

Amendment 1 would fully repeal Article II, Section 1 of the Iowa constitution and replace it with the following text (also seen on [the sample ballot](https://web.archive.org/web/20240922222100/https://www.polkcountyiowa.gov/media/uhyi0t0y/des-moines-39.pdf)):

>Only a citizen of the United States of the age of eighteen years, who shall have been a resident of this state for such period of time as shall be provided by law and of the county in which the citizen claims the citizen' vote for such period of time as shall be provided by law, shall be entitled to vote at all elections which are authorized by law. However, for purposes of a primary election, a United States citizen must be at least eighteen years of age as of the next general election following the primary election. The required periods of residence shall not exceed six months in this state and sixty days in the county.

To put *this* in simple language, should this become law, it would entirely remove the limit imposed on the Iowa government that ensures they can't pass laws designed to prevent citizens from voting. Instead, the new constitutional qualifications are as follows:

* You must be a citizen of the United States
* You are at least 18 years old by the date of the general election
* You have resided in Iowa for at least 6 months
* You have resided in the county you're registering in for at least 60 days

Note the two changes between the list in this section vs the list in the previous section:

1. Citizenship no longer would entitle you to the right to vote, it would simply be a requirement
2. The age threshold is lowered from 21 years old to 18 years old by election day

Because of how this amendment is phrased, should it pass it would then be possible for either (or both) the state of Iowa and/or any municipality within to pass laws that further restrict the voting eligibility of its population to *less than every citizen that resides there.* Laws may also be passed to expand the voting pool, but not in a way that includes non-citizens or individuals younger than the """"18 years old by the general election"""" threshold.

# Why can 17-year-olds currently vote in primaries?

If you were to go to the [Iowa Secretary of State's election FAQ page](https://web.archive.org/web/20240920203715/https://sos.iowa.gov/elections/voterinformation/uocava/faqs.html), you would see a bullet point that indicates that 17-year-olds are eligible to vote even though we just established that the Iowa state constitution explicitly says that your voting rights are only guaranteed if you're at least 21 years old. What gives?

There are two additional laws at play here. First, we have the [26th amendment of the United States constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/amdt26-1/ALDE_00001015/):

>The right of citizens of the United States, who are eighteen years of age or older, to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of age.

The 26th amendment was ratified in 1971, whereas the most recent time Article II, Section 1 of the Iowa state constitution was amended [was in 1970 (pages 9 and 35)](https://web.archive.org/web/20240624210219/https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/publications/ICNST/402724.pdf). Due to [the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artVI-C2-1/ALDE_00013395/), if federal law and state law are ever in conflict, federal law takes priority. As such, the minimum voting age in Iowa was forced to 18 years old by federal law in 1971, despite the state constitution not reflecting that.

The second law at play is [Iowa Code Section 48A.5](https://web.archive.org/web/20240219070543/https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/code//48A.5.pdf) (Voter Qualifications), which was [amended in 2017 (page 13)](https://web.archive.org/web/20230801055939/https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/publications/iactc/87.1/CH0110.pdf) to include the following language:

>To be qualified to register to vote an eligible elector shall \[...\] be at least eighteen years of age. However, for purposes of voting in the primary election, an eligible elector shall be at least eighteen years of age on the date of the respective general election or city election. \[...\] A registrant who is at least seventeen years of age and who will be eighteen by the date of a pending election is a registered voter for the pending election for purposes of chapter 53. For purposes of voting in a primary election under chapter 43, a registrant who will be at least eighteen years of age by the date of the respective general election or city election is a registered voter for the pending primary election.

This language was added to address an argument that any person entitled to vote for a candidate in a general election """"[should also be allowed to choose their party's nominee](https://web.archive.org/web/20160303202709/https://sos.iowa.gov/news/2016_03_02.html),"""" according to Secretary of State Paul Pate. This should look incredibly familiar, as it's the basis for a large (and wholly unproblematic) chunk of the language change for the proposed amendment.

# What's currently preventing non-citizens from voting in Iowa elections?

On its face, the citizenship clause of Amendment 1 looks as though it is seeking to address a loophole that exists in the Iowa Constitution that would allow laws to be passed allowing non-citizens to vote in state and/or local elections. This is the argument made by the organization called [Americans for Citizen Voting](http://web.archive.org/web/20241003200529/https://onlycitizens.vote/), which is the public face of the movement pushing for these constitutional amendments across several states. They misleadingly make the following claim:

>Unless a state’s constitution specifically states that *only* citizens can vote, the possibility of non-citizens *legally* voting exists.

This claim strongly implies that if a state constitution does not specify that """"only a citizen"""" is entitled to vote, that it is inherently legal for non-citizens to vote. Not only is this not true, but a protection against non-citizen voting already exists in Iowa law. [Iowa Code Section 48A.5](https://web.archive.org/web/20240219070543/https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/code//48A.5.pdf) \-- the same portion of State Code that currently allows 17-year-olds to vote in Iowa primaries if they would turn 18 by the date of the general election -- specifically addresses this concern by placing the following restriction:

>To be qualified to register to vote an eligible elector shall \[...\] be a citizen of the United States.

This means that both the maximum and minimum limits of citizenship as it relates to voting rights in Iowa are currently defined by law: every citizen has an inherent right to vote according to the Iowa Constitution, and you must be a citizen to register according to Iowa law. Regardless of what any organization might say to the contrary, for any further laws to be passed that allow non-citizens to vote in local elections, Iowa Code Section 48A.5(2a) would need to first be repealed by the Iowa legislature.

# Does federal law protect your right to vote based on citizenship?

This is where things start to get a little bit hairy. At time of writing, I am not aware of any codified federal law that guarantees that United States citizenship translates into guaranteed voting entitlements in state and local elections. In fact, despite defining how elections would take place for both congressmen and the President, the original text of the United States Constitution [didn't even define who was eligible to vote](https://web.archive.org/web/20240916104358/https://www.archives.gov/news/topics/voting-rights)!

Since the Constitution was written, however, there have been several federal laws passed that impact voter qualifications:

|Law|Text|Impact|
|:-|:-|:-|
|[USC 14th Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-14/) (Section 1) -- 1868|All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.|While this amendment does not specifically reference voter qualifications, the United States Supreme Court has on multiple occasions [interpreted it in that context](https://web.archive.org/web/20240704115346/https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/amdt14-S1-8-6-2/ALDE_00013450/). However, Supreme Court opinions are incredibly dependent on the currently appointed Justices, and based on recent decisions it *should not* be assumed that the current U.S. Supreme Court would find that the 14th Amendment protects voting rights.|
|[USC 15th Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-15/) (Section 1) -- 1870|The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude|Prevents the United States and any state from creating laws aimed at restricting citizens' right to vote based on race.|

Importantly, I do not believe this amendment has ever been interpreted to protect voting rights based on gender identity or sexual orientation.|
|[USC 24th Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-24/) (Section 1) -- 1964|The right of citizens of the United States to vote in any primary or other election for President or Vice President, for electors for President or Vice President, or for Senator or Representative in Congress, shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any State by reason of failure to pay any poll tax or other tax.|Prevents tax-based restrictions from voting in *federal* elections from being implemented. *Does not* apply to state or local elections.|

Provides states and municipalities the opportunity to pass their own laws that allow non-citizens to vote in state and local elections, but it is up to those states and municipalities to individually decide on this.|

Now, rather than voter qualification laws being reviewed by the U.S. Attorney General prior to being enacted, disenfranchised voters are required to build their own case against their state after the fact.|

So, to answer the question in the heading of this section... no. While there are protections against disenfranchisement for certain demographic categories, the federal government offers no guarantee that citizenship entitles you to voting rights, and certainly not in a way that would protect your rights in local elections if a state were to find a way to skirt around the demographic protections.

# What do other state constitutions say regarding citizenship-based voting rights?

Immediately prior to 2018, virtually every state constitution included language that guarantees in some form that citizenship automatically entitles an individual to vote in all elections in their state, so long as that individual meets all other qualifications. [Beginning in 2018](https://ballotpedia.org/Iowa_Amendment_1,_Require_Citizenship_to_Vote_in_Elections_and_Allow_17-Year-Olds_to_Vote_in_Primaries_Amendment_(2024)#Citizenship_voting_requirement_ballot_measures), however, a wave of constitutional amendments containing incredibly similar language have been put up for citizens to decide on in several (typically conservative-leaning) states. This year marks the largest influx of ballot measures containing constitutional amendments containing language that """"only a citizen"""" is entitled to vote, with eight states including Iowa doing so.

Six states have already passed similar amendments, including Ohio, which very shortly after imposed what Ohio Capitol Journal calls  """"[the most restrictive voter photo ID law in the nation](https://web.archive.org/web/20240715220356/https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2023/03/01/a-behind-the-scenes-look-at-how-ohio-enacted-the-most-restrictive-voter-photo-id-law-in-america/)"""". That law has since been upheld in federal court on the grounds that it """"[appears to rise well above the constitutional floor for voting](https://web.archive.org/web/20240914081715/https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/federal-judge-upholds-ohios-2023-omnibus-voter-suppression-law/).""""

It's worth noting that not every single state that passed amendments that require citizenship to vote eliminated the existing language affirming that every citizenship also grants voter rights. Louisiana, for example, was one of the states that [ratified such an amendment in 2022](https://ballotpedia.org/Louisiana_Amendment_1,_Citizen_Requirement_for_Voting_Measure_(December_2022)#What_did_this_amendment_do). That amendment prevents municipalities from allowing non-citizens to vote, but also continues to affirm that all citizens have a right to vote, with the following language:

>(1) Every person who is both a citizen of the state and of the United States, upon reaching eighteen years of age, shall have the right to register and vote, except that this right may be suspended while for a person who is interdicted and judicially declared mentally incompetent or who is under an order of imprisonment for conviction of a felony.  
(2) No person who is not a citizen of the United States shall be allowed to register and vote in this state.

Iowa's proposed amendment crucially does *not* include language that continues to guarantee voting rights, it instead simply replaces the original language.

One of the other states proposing a citizenship voting amendment to their constitution this election cycle is Wisconsin, which has seen [significantly more public opposition](https://ballotpedia.org/Wisconsin_Citizenship_Voting_Requirement_Amendment_(2024)#Opposition) to their amendment. The alterations to the Wisconsin amendment include an identical constitutional language change from """"every citizen"""" to """"only a citizen,"""" and as such the opposition can also be equally applied to Iowa's amendment. The League of Women Voters of Wisconsin has published an excellent and easy-to-digest summary of their opposition to Wisconsin's proposed amendment, which you can find at their website: [https://my.lwv.org/wisconsin/november-2024-constitutional-amendment](https://my.lwv.org/wisconsin/november-2024-constitutional-amendment)

# How can Amendment 1 be weaponized against citizens?

In a previous section, I gave a recent example of an amendment by Iowa's legislature to Section 48A.5. This is an excellent example of the power that Iowa's government has to amend its own election law without additional input from voters, *so long as* it doesn't conflict with the language of the Iowa constitution or federal law. Another section also contains all of the major legislation that I'm aware of that either limits or affirms state voter qualifications at the federal level, and demonstrates that not only are federal protections not all-encompassing, but they have actually been significantly rolled back in recent years.

This creates a situation where virtually the only thing stopping any given state from implementing voter disenfranchisement laws that target nearly any demographic of their choosing is the fact that most states include language in their constitution that affirms that United States citizenship automatically entitles an individual to voting rights.

The key to understanding why this amendment could be used to pave the way for currently unconstitutional voter suppression laws is in the specific language of """"Every citizen of the United States \[...\] shall be entitled to vote"""" vs """"Only a citizen of the United States \[...\] shall be entitled to vote."""" Basically, think of it like this -- the difference is the same as """"Every Reddit user is allowed to comment in r/Conservative"""" vs """"Only Reddit users are allowed to comment in r/Conservative."""" The phrasing that includes """"every"""" would significantly limit r/Conservative's ability to ban and mute users that post opinions differing from the subreddit's target userbase, whereas the phrasing that includes """"only"""" indicates that *of course* you must have a Reddit account to comment, but users can still choose to create posts with """"Flaired users only"""" tags and moderators have the ability to be significantly more heavy-handed when removing comments and banning users from the subreddit, even if no rules were necessarily broken.

All of these factors combined give rise to a very credible concern that amending citizens' guaranteed entitlement to vote out of the state constitution could put Iowa in a position where the passage of a single law would result in widespread voter disenfranchisement. Practically, this could look like anything ranging from individual municipalities passing laws stating that only parents of currently enrolled children can vote in school board meetings, to the state passing a law that to register you must have a mailing address (disenfranchising unhoused individuals), and anything in-between.

Take a moment to think about yourself, and the people you are close to. Think about everything you have in common with them -- and more importantly, everything you *don't*. Then, think about how many of those differences your state or county government have an official record of; any of that demographic information that isn't race, sex, age, or medically diagnosed disability would be fair game for laws restricting your right to vote if Amendment 1 were to pass.

# Who is responsible for putting Amendment 1 on the ballot?

Those of you who have been paying closer-than-average attention to political news over the last year may be reading this and thinking *""""Rolling back voter protections? Voter suppression tactics? Legislation based on the implication that noncitizens are voting in elections? This sounds an awful lot like things I've heard about Project 2025!""""* If that is in fact where your head was at... spoilers. If not, strap in.

**Amendment 1 officially** started its [long, long journey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZ8psP4S6BQ) to the ballot as [Senate Study Bill 1083](http://web.archive.org/web/20210422024105/https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ga=89&ba=SSB1083), when it was passed in February 2021 by the [Senate State Government Committee during the 89th General Assembly](http://web.archive.org/web/20240616123553/https://www.legis.iowa.gov/committees/committee?ga=89&groupID=702). The Committee was chaired by former senator [Roby Smith of Davenport](http://web.archive.org/web/20240626092047/https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislators/legislator?ga=89&personID=9386) (who has since been elected as [State Treasurer of Iowa](http://web.archive.org/web/20240725122549/https://www.iowatreasurer.gov/the-treasurers-office)), and he is also the credited name on the resolution itself. The bipartisan committee of 15 Iowa senators [unanimously passed the bill](http://web.archive.org/web/20240927010740/https://legiscan.com/IA/rollcall/SJR9/id/1005669). Note, however, the phrasing of the included explanation in the bill provided to those senators, which conveniently omits the citizenship aspect of the bill:

>This joint resolution proposes an amendment to the Constitution of the State of Iowa relating to the qualification of electors. The joint resolution reduces the voting age in the Constitution of the State of Iowa from 21 years of age to 18 years of age, except that a person who will be 18 years of age by the next general election shall be permitted to vote in a primary election. Eighteen years of age is the current voting age for every election in the United States due to the adoption of the 26th Amendment to the United States Constitution. The resolution, if adopted, would be published and then referred to the next general assembly (90th) for adoption, before being submitted to the electorate for ratification.

The passage of SSB1083 caused the bill to be referred to the Iowa Senate for a vote as [Senate Joint Resolution 9 during the 90th General Assembly](https://web.archive.org/web/20240919031839/https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ga=89&ba=SJR9). Prior to voting, each Iowa Senator would have been given two pieces of supplemental material to inform their vote; [the text of SJR9](https://web.archive.org/web/20210927232808/https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/publications/LGI/89/attachments/SJR9.html), which is identical to the text of SSB1083, and [this fiscal note](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/publications/FN/1212472.pdf) on the cost of the official process for informing Iowa citizens of an upcoming constitutional amendment. Both of these supplements include descriptions that *only* identify SJR9 as a constitutional amendment affecting age, not citizenship. SJR9 was passed in the Senate in March of 2021, [with all present Iowa senators voting in favor](https://web.archive.org/web/20240927013551/https://legiscan.com/IA/rollcall/SJR9/id/1039345).

The passage of SJR9 in the Iowa Senate sent the bill to the Iowa House of Representatives for a vote. Before voting, the house assembled a subcommittee of three representatives -- [two republicans and one democrat](https://web.archive.org/web/20240927015118/https://www.legis.iowa.gov/committees/meetings/subCommMeeting?meetingID=35305) \-- who met once on March 1st of 2022 before recommending the passage of the bill. This caused a floor vote to be scheduled for March 15th of 2022. The representatives would have had the same supplemental materials as the senators. SJR9 was passed in the senate in March of 2022, [with all present Iowa representatives voting in favor](https://web.archive.org/web/20240927015704/https://legiscan.com/IA/rollcall/SJR9/id/1170386). Having passed in both chambers, the bill officially became a proposed amendment to be put on the ballot for the 2024 general election.

**Happening concurrently** to all of this, Mother Jones published an article in May of 2021 titled [*Leaked Video: Dark Money Group Brags About Writing GOP Voter Suppression Bills Across the Country*](https://web.archive.org/web/20240920194006/https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2021/05/heritage-foundation-dark-money-voter-suppression-laws/). The article reports on the contents of a leaked internal promotion video from the Heritage Foundation, the group responsible for writing and promoting [Project 2025](https://web.archive.org/web/20240925121720/https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-is-project-2025-trump-conservative-blueprint-heritage-foundation/). That article includes the following direct quote from Heritage Foundation Executive Director Jessica Anderson:

>""""Iowa is the first state that we got to work in, and we did it quickly and we did it quietly. We worked quietly with the Iowa state legislature. We got the best practices to them. We helped draft the bills. We made sure activists were calling the state legislators, getting support, showing up at their public hearings, giving testimony…Little fanfare. Honestly, nobody even noticed. My team looked at each other and we’re like, ‘It can’t be that easy.’""""

The leaked video also indicates the states that the Heritage Foundation was focusing their efforts on at that time were Arizona, Michigan, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Nevada, Texas, and Wisconsin. Three of those eight states (including Iowa) have either already passed, or currently have an """"only a citizen"""" law on the ballot this year. The timeline of this video being leaked is only months after the original drafting of SSB1083.

One day after the article about the leaked video was published, the Des Moines Register published an article titled [*A conservative group claimed credit for Iowa's election law. Its GOP author says: 'They're lying.'*](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2021/05/14/republican-lawmaker-says-group-had-nothing-do-iowa-election-law-bobby-kaufmann-heritage-action/5090461001/) Note that while this article is about [Senate File 413](https://web.archive.org/web/20240906191338/https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ga=89&ba=SF%20413) (the law responsible for purging voter rolls of registered voters who miss a single general election), SF413 and SSB1083 have a common author in Senator Roby Smith. The Des Moines Register quotes Sen. Smith as saying the following (emphasis mine):

>""""The Heritage Foundation had no part in the drafting of SF 413. I worked with Rep. Kaufmann, other legislators **and constituents** to draft this election reform proposal.""""

This is, however, completely in line with how the Heritage Foundation claims to operate, with the Des Moines Register including additional information [from a Heritage Foundation spokesperson a few days later](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2021/05/18/conservative-group-heritage-action-says-didnt-lobby-illegally-iowa-election-law-kim-reynolds/5154561001/) in a separate article:

>In \[a letter to Iowa state regulators\], Heritage criticized """"the multitude of inaccurate press accounts over the past week"""" and said it did not lobby on the law.

>In the letter, Byrnes said Heritage Action sent information about the law to its """"grassroots supporters across Iowa"""" who then engaged with legislators.

>""""While no Heritage Action employee or a representative paid to act on its behalf engaged directly with the Iowa Legislature, we are proud to know that our grassroots network answered the call to express their views on this topic of public importance, and that their efforts helped shape legislation that is now law,"""" the letter said.

To recap, this amendment passed with unanimous bipartisan support across both chambers of the Iowa legislature, likely in no small part due to a misleading/incomplete summary of what the amendment would do originally written by Senator Roby Smith. [In the same session that SSB1083/SJR9/Amendment 1 was written](http://web.archive.org/web/20240409040851/https://legiscan.com/IA/bill/SF413/2021), Senator Roby Smith also co-wrote a piece of legislation that the Heritage Foundation claims they provided """"model legislation"""" for, using a """"grassroots network"""" of local constituents to deliver it. The Heritage Foundation has also built a significant scaremongering platform [based on verifying the citizenship status of voters](http://web.archive.org/web/20240729214233/https://www.heritage.org/election-integrity-facts), something that Amendment 1 specifically targets. The Heritage Foundation *also* serves as a convenient coordinating body for all of the states passing constitutional amendments with specific and virtually identical language included, as it is unlikely that legislators from all fourteen states independently came up with the idea in such a short span of time. In short, without Senator Roby Smith or the influence of the Heritage Foundation, Amendment 1 most likely would not be on the Iowa ballot in its current form this fall.

# What can you do about this?

Vote. *Vote.* Vote as though this is the last ballot you can legally cast in a state election, because due to what Amendment 1 would open the door for, there's a non-zero chance that it could be. I would never outright tell a person who or what to vote for, but hopefully this post lays out enough concrete information to inform you on the best decision to make in the case of Amendment 1 for this election.

Contact your representatives. While it is far too late for them to stop it at the floor, they do need to know the monster they've unleashed, and they need to explain to their constituents why they voted for a bill that could have such dire future consequences. I've seen at least one example so far of what appears to be an otherwise well-meaning state representative (Adam Zabner of Iowa City) [that is still responding to interviews](http://web.archive.org/web/20240919003000/https://www.kcrg.com/2024/09/17/election-2024-iowans-decide-constitutional-amendment-voting-age/) as though the only thing that Amendment 1 addresses is minimum voting age. Our state leadership needs to know that the legislation they vote for has real consequences for their constituents, and that if they can't take the time to read and fully understand what they are voting on, they may need to be primaried against someone who has a better care for their constituents' interests in the next election cycle.

If you or someone you know is involved with an Iowan media outlet, please forward this to them! I've already done all of the research grunt work for you, all you need to do is package all the information up in a bow for your readers and viewers.

Spread this. The last thing I care about is fake internet points, I don't care if you print this post out in its entirety and hand it to people or if you plagiarize it wholecloth for a blog or video. The one thing I *do* care about is accuracy; ***do not*** alter the spirit of what is written here with misinformation or disinformation. Not only would it reflect poorly on you, but false or significantly misleading claims significantly compromise the overall message and there is virtually no margin for error here.

Lastly... try to prove me wrong. Like I said at the top of this post, I am committed to updating this masterpost up to election day 2024, even if that means correcting any technicalities that I have genuinely misunderstood. I would *love* to be proven wrong, as it would mean that no Iowans would be in danger of falling under voter suppression laws in the future! So far, though, any critiques have unfortunately only served to strengthen the case that you have just read.

Iowa,1d7ihb7,I wrote a letter to Kim this morning.,"Governor Kim Reynolds
Office of the Governor
State Capitol
Des Moines, IA 50319

Dear Governor Reynolds,

I hope this letter reaches you despite the apparent disconnect from the realities facing the citizens of Iowa. My name is REDACTED, a resident of Riverside, Iowa, who is deeply dismayed by the state of affairs under your administration.

It is with great frustration that I write to you today to address the myriad issues plaguing our state. From inadequate healthcare access to regressive environmental policies, your tenure has been marked by a lack of leadership and a disregard for the well-being of everyday Iowans.

The neglect of our education system, the failure to address systemic inequalities, and the persistent erosion of civil liberties under your watch are simply unacceptable. Instead of championing progress, your administration seems content to prioritize partisan agendas at the expense of the people you were elected to serve. Every single piece of legislation you and your lackeys have passed have ended in erosion of trust and negligible progress made, not to mention the worsening in conditions for the state and its minorities.

I urge you to wake up to the realities facing our state and start governing with the interests of all Iowans in mind. It's time to put aside political gamesmanship and start working towards real solutions to the challenges we face.

I implore you to take immediate action to rectify the damage done and restore faith in our state government. The people of Iowa deserve better than what you have offered thus far. 

Make no mistake, the people of Iowa, whom you have decided to ignore and brigade against solely due to party lines, do not take kindly to politicians of inaction. Your policies are killing people, their blood is on your manicured hands. """"Unfuck"""" yourself, Governor Kim Reynolds, for the betterment of yourself and your people.

Kansas,1dglbma,‘Time for a reckoning.’ Kansas farmers brace for water cuts to save Ogallala Aquifer • Missouri Independent,"JETMORE, Kan. — An inch or two of corn peeks out of the dirt, just enough to reveal long rows forming over the horizon.

Sprinkler engines roar as they force water from underground to pour life into dusty fields.

Thunder cracks. The wind whips up dirt as a trail of dark storms looms. The crashing hot and cold fronts would probably set off tornado sirens — if there were any in this remote part of the state.

It’s spring in southwest Kansas, a hub for the nation’s crop, dairy and beef industries.

As the familiar seasonal rhythm plays out, some farmers are bracing for major changes in how they use the long-depleting Ogallala Aquifer. The nation’s largest underground store of fresh water, the Ogallala transformed this arid region into an agricultural powerhouse.

After 50 years of studies, discussions and hand-wringing about the aquifer’s decline, the state is demanding that local groundwater managers finally enforce conservation. But in this region where water is everything, they’ll have to overcome entrenched attitudes and practices that led to decades of overpumping.

“It scares the hell out of me,” farmer Hugh Brownlee said at a recent public meeting in the district on the changes to come.

Last year, Kansas lawmakers passed legislation squarely targeting the Southwest Kansas Groundwater Management District, which spans a dozen counties. Unlike the two other Kansas districts that sit atop the crucial aquifer, this one has done little to enact formal conservation programs that could help prolong the life of the aquifer. The new law aims to force action.

The district has come under fire from legislators increasingly incensed by its substantial travel expenses, its lack of formal conservation policies and its alienation of farmers who are trying to save water. At a hearing in February on a bill meant to help farmers in one county leave the district, a Kansas House member floated the idea of doing away with the organization, also known as Groundwater Management District 3, altogether.

“Maybe that’s something that we need to consider — just dissolve GMD 3 so that these other boards that are doing good work are not affected,” said state Rep. Cyndi Howerton, a Republican from Wichita.

District leaders think the criticism is unfair. But even they acknowledge that painful change is brewing. Change that will force farmers to cut back.

Clay Scott, a farmer and rancher who has served on the district’s board for more than two decades, said most local farmers are ready to change. That’s partly because they don’t want to give the state a reason to impose its own restrictions, he said.

Scott said the problem of overuse has been generations in the making and can’t be reversed overnight.

“It’s going to take us time to turn this ship around,” he said.

But critics say the organization has already had plenty of time. Decades.

“My biggest disappointment with GMD 3 is they’ve had 50 years to build a consensus on conservation and they failed to do it,” said Frank Mercurio, who works for a dairy with facilities across southwest Kansas and southeast Colorado.

The discussions here mirror those occurring not just across the eight Ogallala states (Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas and Wyoming) but also across the country. The dual threat of climate change and overpumping of groundwater threatens farming and agricultural communities coast to coast.

Outside the town of Syracuse, Kansas, Brownlee runs a small farm with dryland and irrigated fields divided by a curvy two-lane blacktop. More than 200 years ago, Mexican and American traders following the Santa Fe Trail crossed this part of the plains on ox-pulled wagons.

Brownlee, who farms part time and drives a propane truck, said he understands the shrinking water supply. But he thinks the state is to blame — not farmers. Decades ago, Kansas officials issued more water rights than the aquifer can sustain.

The state should fix that, rather than punishing farmers with across-the-board cuts, he said.

“They want to be able to flip the switch and just stop it,” Brownlee said. “That’s not going to do anybody no good.”

‘Should have been done 40 years ago’ 
In a community center on Main Street in Lakin, Kansas, a few dozen farmers in feed and seed hats last month pulled folding chairs off a big metal rack.

Just below the stained drop ceiling panels, a tilted projector shone onto a bare beige wall the district’s plans to comply with the new law. The first step: identifying priority areas for its conservation efforts.

An expert from the Kansas Geological Survey pointed to maps of the district. Blood red blots showed where aquifer conditions were most severe. In some parts of the district, the aquifer is already all but gone. Other areas have more than 60 years of water left even if they don’t cut back their usage.

But at this and a series of meetings across southwest Kansas, district leaders outlined plans to declare its entire territory a priority area. Some critics viewed the move as a stall tactic, but district leaders say it leaves all options available to them. The district in 2026 will have to present an action plan, which it says will reflect the huge variations in aquifer conditions.

Kansas’ chief engineer, Earl Lewis, who will evaluate the board’s plan and future conservation efforts, said the board likely can designate the whole region a priority, though he’s not sure it meets “the spirit” of the law.

In the series of meetings, farmers ran through familiar questions, concerns and excuses.

What about the farms pumping the aquifer down in Oklahoma?

What about all the new dairies and feedlots coming in?

What about city drinking water wells?

Crop irrigation accounts for 85% of all water use in Kansas — even more in western Kansas.

The group also discussed the possibility of paying growers to shut down their wells.

But one farmer said he can’t farm his sandy soil without irrigation. After the meeting, he declined to be named, saying he could get in big trouble for sharing his real feelings.

Local farmer Steve Sterling interjected at the first meeting in Garden City to say conservation planning “should have been done 40 years ago.” Some of his neighbors abandoned their farm when he was 12, he said. They were out of water.

Katie Durham, who manages Groundwater Management District 1 in western Kansas, drove south to attend some of the meetings in GMD 3. She said she hoped the farmers in attendance understood that change is coming under the new law.

“This is happening,” Durham said. “I just hope that urgency and sense of wanting to be involved and kind of taking ownership of the future on a local level — I just hope people are understanding that.”

This is a cultural thing’
Between the 1950s and the 1970s, Kansas created the fundamental problem that allows aquifer depletion by granting farmers the right to pump more water out of the aquifer each year than returns to it via rainfall. But the state has largely left it up to locals to find solutions to the problem.

The state charged the three groundwater management districts over the Ogallala with protecting both the agricultural economy and aquifer water. But their five-decade histories primarily have been marked by further decline of the Ogallala Aquifer. Two districts have made progress in recent years and helped farmers to slow, or even stop, the decline.

GMD 3 is different.

Burke Griggs, a water attorney who previously worked for the state, argues the southwest Kansas district isn’t doing much compared with the other two.

“The law is the same. The regs are basically the same,” he said. “This is a cultural thing.”

He argues the state should take a firmer stance in aquifer management.

“I think it’s time for a reckoning,” Griggs said.

District officials say farmers in GMD 3 have used 13% less water in the past 10 years compared with the decade before. But it’s unclear how much of that change is intentional — from conservation — or a reflection of the limited water available in the declining aquifer.

Though its territory is twice the size of the other two districts’ combined, the southwest Kansas district hasn’t accomplished as much. The other districts have offered financial assistance to farmers investing in water-efficient irrigation systems and championed large-scale restrictions on pumping.

GMD 3 has done none of that. Between 2010 and 2022, financial records show, the district spent, on average, only 13% of the money it budgeted for conservation. In most years, it didn’t spend anything on conservation.

Mark Rude, who has been the organization’s executive director for nearly two decades, said the district’s entire budget supports water conservation. The district takes in more than $1 million per year and spends 70% of that on salaries and benefits, according to financial documents received through a records request. The rest goes largely to office equipment, travel and other administrative costs.

“I mean, ultimately, that’s why we’re here,” Rude said, “and if you look at the $600,000-plus we (spend) on staff, why is the staff here?”

This summer, the district board will consider a 38% increase in the fee it imposes on water users, which is expected to raise more than $200,000 each year. Rude said that money would primarily be used to hire two new employees to help with grant projects offering technical assistance to farmers trying to conserve water.

Between 2010 and 2022, GMD 3 spent about four times as much on travel for Rude and staff as on water conservation. On average, the GMD pays more than $20,000 each year for Rude’s travel — plus another $20,000 for the rest of its staff members — compared with $10,000 for water conservation.

Last year, the district changed its financial statements, reporting fewer, broader categories. The new financial structure did not distinguish travel costs from other expenses.

Rude defends the spending by saying it’s necessary to build the partnerships and relationships needed to achieve district goals, including its aim of piping in water from out of state.

“How else do you do it?” Rude said. “Really, please show us: How else do you do it?”


Last year, lawmakers from both sides of the aisle questioned Rude during a committee hearing on why the district wasn’t doing more to conserve groundwater.

State Rep. Lindsay Vaughn, an Overland Park Democrat, said during a legislative hearing that the district had 50 years to act but made no progress on addressing aquifer decline.

“The issue is only becoming more urgent,” Vaughn said, “and I am discouraged to see that there aren’t any real efforts right now to get the ball rolling and coming up with a long-term plan.”

The district’s lack of action also has drawn the attention of farmers who mounted a campaign to secede.

In 2022, Hamilton County farmers submitted a petition to withdraw from the groundwater district.

They characterized the organization as a bureaucratic mess with a ballooning budget that spends little on conservation, obstructs programs meant to slow groundwater decline and provides no benefits for dryland farmers who also pay assessments.

The petition criticized groundwater district leaders’ fixation on building an aqueduct across the state. The organization twice has trucked water 400 miles from the Missouri River to western Kansas in an effort to sell the idea.

In their petition, Hamilton County farmers said the project only managed to move and dump water with “no tangible benefit to anyone.”

Richard Geven, owner of the 10,000-head Southwest Plains Dairy, was among those who signed the petition to leave.

Geven, a native of the Netherlands who has been farming here for nearly 20 years, said he sees little reason for the groundwater district. When he has issues with his wells or needs clarity on water rights, he works with state regulators.

But he pays assessments every year to the district.

“We don’t know what the purpose is,” he said. “We think, ‘What are they doing? We don’t need them.’”

‘They will face the same choices’
Across most of the Ogallala states, governments have preferred to encourage voluntary conservation rather than mandating steep cutbacks, said Kevin Wagner, director of the Oklahoma Water Resource Center at Oklahoma State University.

Oklahoma allows farmers to use up to 2 feet of water each year on every acre they own. But usage is not monitored. Farmers report annual estimates of water usage.

And the state has not banned the drilling of new irrigation wells.

Researchers have closely monitored the decline of the aquifer across the Oklahoma Panhandle — it’s dropping about half a foot per year, he said.

But there’s no telling how much individual farmers are using or conserving.

“When I talk to producers in Oklahoma, there’s a lot of feeling that Oklahoma producers are doing just as good at conserving as their neighbors in Texas and in Kansas,” Wagner said. “And honestly there’s no data out there right now.”

Oklahoma state Rep. Carl Newton, a Republican, introduced legislation this year that would require irrigators to meter their water use.

The measure passed, but amid steep opposition from agriculture trade groups, Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt vetoed it. He called it government overreach and a violation of private property rights.

Newton said he plans to reintroduce the bill, which he described as “a starting point” for conservation efforts.

“You’ve got to find out where your problem is to get an idea of where to go,” he said. “That was my whole goal.”

Kansas started requiring irrigators to install meters and report water usage in the early 1990s.

We all understand that we are sucking water out of a bathtub. And the rate we’re taking it out of the bathtub exceeds the rate Mother Nature can put it back in.

Formal conservation efforts have been underway in other parts of the region for years.

In Nebraska’s Republican River Basin, groundwater regulators have helped producers install soil moisture probes and more accurate meters that use telemetry to conserve. And Colorado offers a master irrigator course to help farmers grow crops more efficiently.

In Wichita County, Kansas, just beyond the bounds of GMD 3, farmers created a conservation program that launched in 2021. Called a local enhanced management area, farmers committed to cutting water use by at least 25%.

Farmer Don Smith said the program provided a chance for locals to act together before the state stepped in.

Smith, his brother and nephews together run Smith Family Farms, which grows corn, wheat and milo against a backdrop of massive wind turbines. Shiny grain bins emblazoned with the family name tower near the office, where a curious Australian shepherd keeps watch, rearing up on hind legs to peer through the door.

The farm is mostly dryland. Its irrigated fields draw upon 38 wells, connected to advanced sprinkler systems that help reduce water use. The farm also has transitioned to no-till methods, which keeps more moisture in the soil.

Smith said the farm shows that growers can save water and still make money. Lower water use does lead to lower yields, he said. But it also makes growing crops less expensive.

Smith knows the groundwater district just to his south has deeper wells and more abundant water. But the declining aquifer eventually will force changes there.

“I guess it’ll be interesting to see if at some point somebody responds before the gun’s to their head,” he said. “They will face the same choices we all north of them have had to face.”

In Wichita County, Smith said, test wells show the changes have slowed or even reversed aquifer decline. But even so, he doesn’t think irrigated farming will last forever. He expects the day will come when pumping small amounts of water won’t be worth the cost.

“We all understand that we are sucking water out of a bathtub,” he said. “And the rate we’re taking it out of the bathtub exceeds the rate Mother Nature can put it back in.”",1718467671,137,https://missouriindependent.com/2024/06/14/time-for-a-reckoning-kansas-farmers-brace-for-water-cuts-to-save-ogallala-aquifer/,24,como365,,,Health,72,299.6

Kansas,1d8aujo,Sons of Wichita - I'm surprised this hasn't been banned from every library and erased from history,"If you have seen the hit show Succession, I have a hell of a story for you.

Let me describe to you a family dynasty that makes soap operas seem tame. 

The patriarch of the family came from humble beginnings. His father was an European immigrant who made his fortunes in ranching, media and eventually the petroleum industry. 

The patriarch was hard on his four children. The oldest was something of a black sheep. He wanted nothing to do with the """"family business"""" and he ultimately settled into a world of cocktail parties, fine art galleries and ineffable seclusion.

The second oldest was daddy's golden boy. He had his issues with drugs, maybe telling himself the pressure to follow in his father's footsteps was the reason. He was the unofficial successor of the family business.

The third youngest was a constant rival and simultaneous advocate of the second youngest boy. They would spar, physically and intellectually, but in the end they would work together to try to supplant the patriarch's tired old yes-men. 

Then we have the youngest boy. He was an angry, volatile kid who was not indifferent to the family enterprise but wholly wreckless towards their reputation. 

I'm describing the Koch family. 

I checked out a book at my local library in Kansas and I'm shocked this book is on public shelves. The parallels between the Kochs and the Roys are unnerving. The show Yellowstone is also somewhat applicable here, but its the Roys that seem to reflect the Koch family so succinctly. 

At the end of chapter one of Sons Of Wichita, a friend of the family remarks:

Kansas,188qbst,A Non-Kansan Redesigns the Kansas License Plate,"Hi there!

I'm a West Coast graphic designer who heard about y'all's license plate dilemma, so here's my take on it! 

My design fits your governor's design criteria and is a hybrid of various standard and vanity license plates throughout Kansas history. I put in a lot of research before I put out any design, but I'm curious as to what people from Kansas think about it.

\---

For some background, I completed a passion project two years ago where I redesigned the license plates for all American states & territories and Canadian provinces & territories. I challenged myself to create entirely new designs for each jurisdiction, regardless of whether or not I liked their current ones.

*^((I've made a few tweaks to my original Kansas redesign to fit the license plate criteria))*

If you're interested, you can look through my other license plate concepts here:

Kentucky,19ailb1,"Confluence of Green and Rough Rivers, Livermore, KY (sometime in 2018, I believe)","This photo was taken by a friend of a friend visiting for Thunder on the Green 2018, if I am remembering correctly. 

Livermore, Kentucky is located at a point which once boasted """"two rivers, two bridges, two counties."""" Two rivers, the smaller Rough on the left and the famous Green on the right, meet here and create a point of land between them. 

The Point is part of Ohio County, and requires driving a few miles down gravel roads to access without a boat. Years ago, it was used by the local Boy Scouts as a camping area, then it exchanged hands a couple times and is now privately owned. The land on either side of the rivers is part of McLean County. 

There is only one bridge now, and that is the US Hwy 431 bridge. Each end terminates in McLean County, but for a short moment, you are in Ohio County while crossing it. Just below the boat ramp to the left of The Point is a small column which used to be part of a rail bridge operated by Louisville and Nashville Railroad. It has a sister column on the right side, but that one has been overgrown by vegetation. The accessible one has been turned into a viewing platform with benches and a park built around it. A plaque about halfway up the stairs to the viewing platform is a marker noting the water level of the 1937 flood.

The white silos in the lower right are the Perdue Feed Mill, formerly (and currently by some locals) known as Bungee.

Everything about the place is soothing. The air even smells different. The sense of the good ole Kentucky. It feels historic and frankly, right at home.

Louisiana,1ex8qir,Corruption in La.,"A few minutes ago I asked Venice (a paid A.I. program) this question:  
""""Compared to other states how bad is the corruption in louisiana""""

And this was it's answer:

  
""""Louisiana has historically been considered one of the most corrupt states in the United States. A 2017 report by [Cheatsheet.com](http://Cheatsheet.com) ranked Louisiana as the second-most corrupt state, while a 2020 report by U.S. News & World Report ranked it fifth.

There are several reasons why corruption is prevalent in Louisiana:

1. Political Culture: Louisiana has a long history of patronage and political favoritism, with politicians often rewarding friends and supporters with government jobs or contracts.
2. Weak Campaign Finance Laws: Louisiana's campaign finance laws are relatively lax compared to other states, allowing for large contributions from special interest groups and individuals.
3. Lack of Transparency: The state has limited disclosure requirements for lobbyists, candidates, and public officials, making it difficult to track the flow of money and influence in government.
4. Judicial Corruption: In recent years, Louisiana has experienced several high-profile cases of judicial corruption, with judges being accused of bribery or other forms of misconduct.
5. Police Misconduct: Louisiana also has a history of police brutality and misconduct, with multiple investigations and lawsuits alleging abuse of power by law enforcement.

While it's difficult to quantify the exact level of corruption in each state, Louisiana consistently ranks near the top of such lists due to its political culture, weak governance structures, and historical patterns of malfeasance. Efforts to combat corruption in the state have been ongoing, with some success; however, there is still much work to be done to ensure that public officials act with integrity and transparency.""""

Louisiana,18rher9,Possible recreational marijuana legalization in 2024?,"Ok so a lot of you are going to tell me I’m crazy and it’ll never happen in Louisiana. You all have every reason to be skeptical because history has shown us Louisiana is the slowest moving state in the whole Union. But hear me out.

Richard Nelson is now the head of the Department of Revenue. His recreational legalization bill nearly passed in 2021. Cutting the state income tax and replacing it with things like a rec weed tax was an issue he campaigned on in the past governor’s election. He now holds more power than he did as a state representative. He now has the ability to gain enough support in the Legislature to get this passed. 

I have also heard through the grapevine amongst individuals close to the governor who say Landry doesn’t necessarily support rec legalization but would sign a bill if it came across his desk due to the need for it in the state. Louisiana has issues with alcohol and hard drug addiction, and having a safer option available for those suffering is something Landry supports.",1703622476,242,https://www.reddit.com/r/Louisiana/comments/18rher9/possible_recreational_marijuana_legalization_in/,175,deleted,,,Health,151.3,396

 I’m a pharmacy tech now, I make $17/hour. Have about $7k in savings and save $700-1k a month. I also freelance art, and I’m redoing my portfolio, so hopefully I’ll be outta the slump I’ve been in. Have a roommate, and my husband, together in an apartment in Houma, because just two of us couldn’t afford an apartment in *Houma*. Much less the roommate. They’re both electricians at a pretty big company down here, and they make $18/hr. Our rent is $1k. 

The pay here is so abysmal. Even if I go back to design and work my way up, I’d clear maybe $20-22. Husband and roomie could do better, but the trade companies here suck so bad I could make another post about them entirely. Chew you up and spit you out. 

I’m trying so hard to love this state and stay. I really am, but I’m sure you all know how frustrating it is to be here. The only thing keeping me here is my lifelong friends and some family. 

We are desperately saving to move. We cut our expenses down so much. Just bills and groceries. We are all so exhausted. 😩 Thinking about moving makes me so sad. I don’t want to leave my family or friends. I love it here, culture and food are the best. It’s home! But we can’t justify this cost of living for so little, and these hurricanes are getting crazier. We have friends in Colorado, so we were looking  there. Maybe Texas, even though it’s crazy over there we could make more.

Just call the state troopers supervisor and get it cleared up.

I got a letter in the mail from Ascension Parish Sheriff's Office saying I skipped a court hearing on my traffic ticket for speeding. The issue was that I was never pulled over for speeding and I live in Caddo Parish and have never been to Ascension Parish in my life. It became a headache because the sheriff's office told me that even though they sent the letter they couldn't do anything because it was a state trooper that wrote the ticket. I had to call the troop of that trooper and speak to his supervisor. He reviewed the body cam footage and saw it wasn't me. What happened was that they're using a new digital system and my license number was similar to the person who received the ticket. The trooper didn't double check before putting it in and I got the ticket and letter saying I had a bench warrant. Hopefully this doesn't happen to anyone else but just a warning to others.

Louisiana,1fban4v,Do Louisianans know about misoprostol being restricted?,"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/louisiana-law-abortion-pills-controlled-dangerous-substances-rcna153937

Misoprostol is one of the top emergency medicines used for hemorrhage during childbirth. It's literally one of the WHO's essential medications they recommend that every clinic in the world should have. It's used for other things too, including sometimes abortion care in places where that's legal.

Louisiana is making misoprostol a """" controlled dangerous substance"""", so that providers delivering babies will have to wait for it to come from somewhere else in the hospital, rather than having it immediately on hand. (It's basically like saying you can't keep your Epi-Pen on you, but rather you have to go get it from a pharmacy *after* you start having an allergic reaction.)

This is so insanely dangerous it's hard for me to imagine how this made it through the Louisiana legislature. Abortion is already banned in Louisiana! This makes no difference for abortion care but directly threatens maternal health. Do people not know? What's the messaging on the ground there?",1725725769,263,https://www.reddit.com/r/Louisiana/comments/1fban4v/do_louisianans_know_about_misoprostol_being/,105,merlereagle,,,Health,151.3,396

Maine,1b8e9uo,One of the best obits I've read,"https://www.penbaypilot.com/article/morris-stanley-wood-obituary/183398

Morris “Stanley” Wood, 100, of Searsport, passed away on February 19, 2024 at the Sussman House in Rockport. He decided to write his own obituary saving loved ones the task. 

My name is M. Stanley Wood and I died of old age at 100. I decided to write my own obituary to reduce the pressure created at such times. The family typically has a work session, and thinking deadline have a resulting snapshot in cradle to grave format, or they create one last stanza about someone’s life that is so glowing one would think the deceased had been the living embodiment of a deity, neither of which I wish. Either of these would be written under the pressure of time.   

I could picture a bunch of my friends sitting around reading a glowing report of me, which we all know would be filled with fish tales, half-thoughts, impossible scenarios, and may be an exaggeration or two. Obituaries should stick to the truth with a trifle of flowery stuff considering the occasion.   

Born on August 28, 1923, I am the son of Maurice and Caroline (Sheldon) Wood and was brought up on a dairy farm in Belfast during the 1930’s depression, attending a one-room school and graduating from Crosby High School in Belfast. 

During WWII, I enlisted in the U.S. Army serving aboard a rescue salvage vessel, LT-464. We were a contingent of 61 vessels known as “Miki Tugs, I, ultimately being billed as the last of the 1200 known crew members.  Closing the book on this is not the most enviable accomplishment. 

After the war, I met and married my lovely wife, Dorothy Bowen, living in Belfast, Swanville and Searsport. “Dot” has been an indispensable part of my life, working as a team whenever necessary. Anything as positive in this writing can be a co-result of Dot’s diligence.  Dot has an admirable life history in health care related fields including nursing, hospice, dentistry, and later, volunteering.  All while she was busy with projects of her own. 

Survivors include my wife, Dorothy; nieces, Marjorie Cormier and husband, Victor of Chesterville, Maureen Brown and husband, Mel, of Vassalboro, Mary Labbe of Peaks Island, Janice Sherburn of Florida, Jeanne Searls of Florida, and nephew, Alfred Wood and wife, Dianne of Peaks Island.   

My life was not perfect as I encountered some bumps in the road. I think that would eradicate most of my fashion disasters and hair missteps from the 1980’s. But mostly, I enjoyed life. Some parts of it were more difficult than others, but I learned something from every bad situation, and I couldn’t do any more than that. 

Besides there are some benefits to living to be “old”, for example. You get to see what’s known as “The Golden Years”, I am no longer afraid of serial killers, telemarketers, or the IRS. I don’t have to worry about wrinkles or the ozone layer and/or hide from the news during the political election season. 

Some folks told me that writing my own obituary was morbid, but I think it has been inspirational because I get a chance to say thank you to all the people who helped me along the way. Those who loved, me, assisted me, cared for me, laughed with me and taught me things so that I could have a wonderful, happy life. I was blessed beyond measure by knowing all of you. That is what made my life worthwhile. 

If you think of me, and would like to do something in honor of my memory, do this: 

Volunteer at a school, church or library. 

Write a letter to someone and tell them how they have had a positive effect on your life. 

If you smoke, quit. 

It you drink and drive, stop. 

Avoid the phone while driving and take a child out for ice cream and talk to them about their hopes and dreams. 

Forgive someone who doesn’t deserve it. 

Stop at all lemonade stands run by children and brag about their product. 

Make someone smile today if it is in your power to do so. 

May God be at your side providing you wisdom for the rest of your life. 

 

An hour of visitation will be held Tuesday, February 27, 2024, at 1 p.m., followed by a funeral service at 2 p.m, at the Long Funeral Home, 9 Mountain Street, Camden.

Spring burial will be in the Morrill Village Cemetery.

Maine,1eaanu9,Cove shitters,"Just found out that a property owned by a wealthy family across the small cove from our family home has a state issued permit to discharge their sewage overboard. They can afford to do it differently. There is a grant that helps pay for people to get rid of their overboard discharge situations. But they have been doing this for decades.  Our other neighbors found toilet paper floating around and looked into the state DEP site and found out why.
I feel I need to take action. We've been swimming in there for years without knowing. It is a disgrace and feels disgusting. They sit on their deck watching us swim!
Should I suggest they apply for the grant or just go straight to concrete?

Update:  thanks for all this input. I have since been back to the DEP website and found a map that shows all the overboard discharge systems in the whole town. There are a surprising number of them.
It shows that this particular system has been removed. I guess that's good but still I wonder where that toilet paper came from. Maybe a boat or someone else's OBD system that is still active.

Maryland,1f53xwx,Woman charged with DUI after police say she caused 20-vehicle chain-reaction crash on Bay Bridge,"On a foggy Saturday morning, a [series of crashes on the westbound span of the bridge involving around 40 vehicles](https://wtop.com/anne-arundel-county/2024/01/at-least-12-hospitalized-chesapeake-bay-bridge-closed-after-crash-involving-estimated-20-vehicles/) (when counting secondary crashes that followed the initial chain-reaction crash) led to a six-hour traffic jam Jan. 27.

After months of investigating, [Maryland Transportation Authority officers](https://mdta.maryland.gov/blog-category/mdta-police-news/mdta-police-announce-arrest-connected-january-crash-bay-bridge) took Gwendolyn Persina, 48, of Chester, Maryland, into custody Wednesday, according to a news release.

  
I just came back from Rehobeth over this bridge and it makes my blood boil to think this woman was already on parole for drunk driving when she did this on arguably a seriously dangerous bridge in perfect conditions. 

Not at all sure why this investigation took so long. 

No mugshot available anywhere.

No reason to believe she wasn't drinking and driving in the 6 months this took unless she had a breathalyzer ignition lock. 

You can't REALLY calculate the financial, emotional and physical damage she did that day

She clearly doesn't deserve to walk among us.

Maryland,1fqw7w3,Are you Wednesday’s human? (BARCS post),"From BARCS Animal Shelter:

My name is Wednesday, and I’m that dog who just doesn’t seem to get it right, even when I’m trying my best. Let me explain–I always get it right in my foster home. There, I’m such a good girl. I listen to instructions, I think I’m a lap dog, I get in there for bear hugs and I take very good care of my little stuffies. I like to deep sleep with my face buried right into the humans’ chests because their heartbeat makes me feel safe. I appreciate my treats, my bed, breakfast, dinner and all of my toys. I remember what it was like to not have these things before coming to BARCS.

But, when it’s time to meet new people, that’s when I always seem to mess it up, even though I don’t mean to.
When I’m outside of my foster home, I’m just not myself, and people get the wrong impression of me. I scream with excitement, I scramble and hyperfixate on just about everything except the people right in front of my face. I just don’t know what comes over me. By the time I’m ready to connect with potential new families, they’ve moved on to meet other dogs. Sometimes, they even act like they’re scared of me, all because of my screams and jumps. I wish I didn’t do that, but I just can’t seem to get it right.

It also upsets all the other dogs at the adoption events, so everyone says it’s best for me to just stay home and sit them out. 😞

Back in April, however, there was a wonderful girl who did take a chance on me and I got adopted. She really loved me, and I loved her too. When we met, she wasn’t startled by me like so many people are. She waited for me to calm down, and I made sure to be an extra good girl–even if that meant I was vibrating heavily while trying to hold my sit. But I did it. I showed her I was going to be a wonderful companion and her best friend. When we got home, I kept all my good manners—my crate training, my potty training, and how I took care of my toys and stuffies like they were my babies. But then something really sad happened. Her job changed, and she had to travel almost 100% of the time. She had to leave faster than she thought, and her job told her she would be gone for months. They didn’t even give us enough time to figure it out. She told me she loved me and didn’t want me to live a whole life with pet sitters, so she asked my foster family if they would take me back.

I really thought she was the one. But now I have to try again.

Next week, I’m coming up on my two-year anniversary of being “Wednesday With No Last Name.” Yes, BARCS and my fosters believe in me and have stuck it out for two years.

But with the shelter out of space and struggling with funding, it’s not fair to other dogs who need a chance too if I can’t find a home. And I know you’re going to ask—“Wednesday, why can’t you just get adopted by your foster family?” Well, they have another dog like me named Short Rib, whose life they also saved from BARCS. We both do not like other dogs, so we have to live “half lives” in the house. I live upstairs, and he lives downstairs. Every day that I’m there, I take his mom and dad away from him 50% of the time.

And that’s not fair to Short Rib. It’s also not fair to me. I want a full-time mom or dad all to myself—and I think I deserve one. But I just need to find the right humans. They can’t have another puppy or any kitties. And I probably will live best with kids who are old enough to understand that I have those little quirks when I’m not at home, and can get pretty bouncy.

The BARCS social media girls have posted me dozens of times, and no one ever shares my posts. We really need it to work this time, so can you please help share my letter? Tell everyone that “Wednesday With No Last Name” is a velco puppy and sure to be someone's next heart dog. Tell them, that I am loyal and won’t ever forget that they are the ones who saw past my flaws and gave me a chance...

...to get it right.

Maryland,1g4ay5y,People's Attitudes Toward Prince George's County,"I have been a part of this subreddit for a little while now. But, it's incredibly disheartening when people say, """"I'm thinking of moving to Prince George's County,"""" and in response, people tell them to avoid it at all costs and call it """"plead guilty,"""" among other things. To me, it's all racism. And, as someone who loves Maryland, I find it incredibly disappointing that so many people hold these opinions. 

I was born and raised in PG County, but I've lived in Baltimore City, Havre De Grace, and Montgomery County. I've always been aware that there are """"two Marylands"""" from a cultural sense. But I also know most people have more in common than we do not. Although all of these places are geographically different, the majority of people that I meet are kind and accepting, and there is a strong sense of community wherever I go. 

There is good and bad wherever you go. No place will exclude you from being a crime victim or having a negative overall experience in that place. However, making blanket statements about an area or people based on a small sample of experiences is extremely irresponsible.

Maryland,1dwmvhf,BEACH GOERS/ THOSE THAT USE THE BAY BRIDGE- Please Take Note:,"This isn’t a hard concept. X means the lane is CLOSED. You must get over while it still has a yellow X. It’s a hefty ticket, otherwise. It doesn’t matter if the 2 open lanes are backed up 2 miles, and the red lane is open- if it’s red, it’s closed.

I live down here, I travel this bridge daily. The amount of people I see ignoring this- only to be caught off guard by the newly installed gates & almost hit either them or another car, is mind boggling. Don’t be one of those entitled people.


2) I ask you please stay on 50. I get it- traffic sucks. The small town along the highway were not built for that type of infrastructure though. By all means, I’m not saying stop for gas/food/etc. I just ask don’t cut through the small town’s ONLY road (aside from 50), making their everyday lives impossible. Especially on Kent island- which is a literal island. I promise using the one back road isn’t going to help you beat any traffic. It’ll only slow you down. They’ve started closing the 50 on ramps because of this practice, on Both sides - & we’re not happy about it, either. It affects us too. 

So from a shore local, I humbly ask: PLEASE be respectful of these small towns. We want yall to enjoy yourselves at your final destination- & please stop by! A lot of the little towns are quite cute with charm & history! Just don’t use them as a racetrack & way to “beat the traffic.” Because I promise- you’re not lol

Edit: to the folks saying """"don't worry"""" or """"this is stupid"""" - one can ask a theoretical question without hysteria. Asking a hypothetical question does not equate to inciting fear. Also - my question specifically says if some of those project 2025 goals were met - which whatever way you turn it, some of his campaign platforms match with. I do not think it is a horrible exercise to question what the future could look like. And it's not """"giving up"""" to ask this - instead, it could paint what could be a possible image of the future for folks. Isn't that exactly what an educated populace should think about when voting - what the future could look like if either candidate won?

Massachusetts,1cu2jo6,"20 years ago today, Mass became the first state to legalize same sex marriage","On Nov 18, 2003, the Mass Supreme Court ruled that restrictions on same sex marriage were unconstituional.  Their ruling went into effect May 17, 2004; 20 years ago today.  And, we have come a long way.  Over 80% of Bay Staters today support the rights of same sex couples to marry, the highest support in the nation.  

Despite this, haters remain around us.  They are attempting to get elected to local school boards, not to make schools better but to ban inclusive curriculae. Proud Boys and similar groups have shut down Drag Queen Storyhours.  Librarians and teachers are under attack for curating inclusive materials.  Queer youth continue to be marginalized in some schools.  

Gay couples only seek the same rights as straight people, the right to love, marry, raise a family, be recognized when their spouse or child faces a medical emergency.  

Worldwide, gay couples can now marry in 37 nations, including most of North and South America, most of Western Europe, and in Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, Nepal, and South Africa. Massachusetts played no small role in that struggle for queer equality.

Massachusetts,1ftbdde,Think I was about to get jumped at Mass Pike rest stop,"Just need to tell this story as not really sure who else I’d tell.

Driving home on the Pike around 5:30 today, so traffic was dense. Was going to stop for something to eat, so was trying to get over to the right lane to get off at the Framingham rest stop. Didn’t cut anyone off, but with traffic that dense, I had to take what I could get and slipped into a reasonable but fairly tight opening between two cars in the right lane just before the exit.  The car behind made a point of closing the gap on me and getting right up on my bumper. I looked back and he kind of made an annoyed gesture with his hand, but nothing too bad. Whatever, not the last time someone will be annoyed on the Pike and the dude looked like a kind of meatball that probably flicks off 3 drivers on the pike everyday

Anyways, I get off at the rest stop and I see he’s getting off too. I kept my eyes on him just to see if he turned and stop following me. He doesn’t turn for Starbucks. He doesn’t turn into the main parking area. He doesn’t turn to get gas, and he’s still right behind me as we’re to the end of the rest stop at the convenience store, which is weird because like 95% of people head to the gas station or the main parking area. I slow down for a parking space and see he’s turning into the same store. Feeling a little off with the situation and just feeling like something was wrong, I just drive away and get back on the Pike.

As I’m driving towards the Pike, I look back and see he stopped turning into the store and is now heading toward the Pike too. He got on behind me and then flew by me in the left lane and I didn’t see him again.

Dunno, maybe he was just looking to yell because he thought I cut him off or something. But just had this bad feeling as soon as he got off the pike, and he was clearly following me to confront me at the store given the way he followed me all the way to the end and then decided not to stop when he realized I wasn’t stopping. Someone who needs to following someone to a rest stop because they slightly cut in front of them to get off the highway is probably unhinged a bit in general, so no idea where it stopped.",1727743156,698,https://www.reddit.com/r/massachusetts/comments/1ftbdde/think_i_was_about_to_get_jumped_at_mass_pike_rest/,206,CrossCycling,,,Defense and National Security,294,673.9

Massachusetts,1g1kio5,I am a middle school teacher. Here is why I am voting to KEEP the MCAS graduation requirement next month.,"**IF** Question 2 *ELIMINATED* the MCAS entirely, I would happily vote for it in a heartbeat.

**HOWEVER**, this question does **NOT** do that. Instead, it KEEPS the test, while merely making passing it no longer a high school graduation requirement. I can tell you, from direct classroom experience, *EXACTLY* what WILL happen as soon as you do that:

At the middle school level, my students also have to take the MCAS, but it does not “count” for anything at our level. *And the kids know this full well.* Every year come test time, there is at least one of my students who will explicitly verbalize a variant of “Middle school MCAS doesn’t count, so I’m not going to bother trying.” And for every student who actually says it aloud, there are plenty of others who silently agree. The result is, no matter how much we teachers beg and plead “Please do your best!” and “Show us what you really know!”, the kids WILL rush through the test, picking random multiple choice answers and writing one-sentence (or one-word!) “essays.” Therefore, our middle school scores are less-than-optimal. Even the kids that we KNOW should score well, based on their classroom performance, frequently fare poorly. BUT…as soon as those same kids get to high school and the test suddenly “counts,” their scores quickly improve. It’s not due to any real difference among the teachers; we hold the same licenses, teach with the same rigor, attend the same professional developments, utilize the same resources…the **ONLY** difference is that in high school, the test finally “matters.” So NOW the kids are finally putting some effort into it. 

It’s kid psychology 101: as soon as you tell students something “isn’t for a grade/won’t be on their report card/doesn’t impact their class placements,” **THEY.STOP.CARING.** Telling the kids they still have to take MCAS but it doesn’t “count” for anything renders the test completely pointless because it will not be an accurate gauge of what the kids can or can’t do.

In the meantime, the test scores are what the state uses to judge the success of schools. Last year’s scores were just released on Monday and we’ve already spent multiple hours this week in mandatory after-school meetings analyzing them, supposedly using that “data” to try to determine what and how to teach differently. The biggest issue my school saw? Low essay scores. What did the students report to us after the test? “Oh yeah,  I wrote a couple sentences or a paragraph” 🤦🏻‍♀️

But of course, this ballot question does nothing to stop the state from continuing to measure schools by their test scores and requiring us to alter our teaching based on those numbers. So if Question 2 passes, the state will be making judgements and the teachers will be teaching based on inaccurate data. So what will be the point? 

TL/DR: Either keep the test and make it count, or eliminate it entirely. Having kids take a test with no consequences will not result in accurate scores.

PS: Don’t believe me? Check out this post from another teacher about their administrator telling them to bribe their students just to get them to try on the test: https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/s/6Vm7ADUiri",1728681875,603,https://www.reddit.com/r/massachusetts/comments/1g1kio5/i_am_a_middle_school_teacher_here_is_why_i_am/,599,Current-Photo2857,,,Environment and Natural Resources,294,673.9

Massachusetts,1dclcvs,Why is this state constantly ranked such a great place to raise kids if it's so expensive?,"Born and raised in Massachusetts. While I definitely do value the education system here and enjoyed growing up in a vibrant community, since then:

* The cost of living has skyrocketed. Homes have skyrocketed. I will never be able to afford a home in the neighborhood I grew up in. And I will never be able to afford any house in this state.
* None of my friends/ acquaintances from my high school and college graduating classes that still live in Massachusetts have kids. And I am late 20s/early 30's.
   * Those that do have kids moved either to New Hampshire or Maine. Most have left New England entirely.
   * Most of my the people in my graduating class that still live here are still living with roommates while hitting 30. Not a great environment to raise a family in.
   * Ironically, the ones with the best life appear to have given up on a """"normal life"""" entirely, and now travel the country in a van or truck camper, working remotely. They also do not plan to have kids.

In other words: Massachusetts may still be #1 in education but what's the point if younger generations can't even consider having kids here because of cost? It may have been a great place for boomers/previous generations to start a family--but that is no longer the case.",1718025650,533,https://www.reddit.com/r/massachusetts/comments/1dclcvs/why_is_this_state_constantly_ranked_such_a_great/,605,climberskier,,,Environment and Natural Resources,294,673.9

Michigan,1g9hi87,Report: 1 in 3 Michigan charter schools fails,"

A new report analyzing nationwide school closures shows in Michigan, about one in three charter schools fails.

Michigan has the largest number of charter schools run by for-profit companies in the nation, with more than 80% run specifically by charter management groups. The report found backers of the schools accept closures as a natural consequence of market forces.

Mitchell Robinson, member of the Michigan State Board of Education, suggested charter schools are being treated a lot like dry cleaners or dollar stores. They pop up in strip malls, he said, and can be gone just months later.

“Our state is attracting people who put profits before the best interests of kids and families, teachers and our state, and that’s unacceptable,” Robinson asserted.

Expenditures include millions of federal dollars allocated to Michigan for charter schools which have never opened, Robinson added. The report, from the National Center for Charter School Accountability, found nearly half of the charter schools closing nationwide cited low enrollment as the reason. About 20% of closures were due to fraud and mismanagement of funds.

Sen. Dayna Polehanki, D-Livonia, proposed legislation this summer to require the same level of transparency for charter schools as public schools, but it has not passed. Robinson thinks greater transparency would help families make more informed choices about where to send their kids to school.

“Teachers don’t think of their kids as child-shaped ATMs, we think of our kids as human beings that are the best things that their families are sending to us every day, that their hopes and dreams are wrapped up in, and we’re trying to help those kids become who they want to be,” Robinson emphasized. “In a lot of charter schools, they’re seeing kids as dollars.”

Michigan spends more than $1 billion on charter schools per year, according to the State Board of Education, all of which are state funded. As of the last school year, there were more than 360 charter schools in Michigan. They enroll about 11% of the state’s 1.4 million K-12 students.",1729601912,1326,https://www.953mnc.com/2024/10/20/report-1-in-3-michigan-charter-schools-fails/,322,ddgr815,,,Health,238.6,1112

Michigan,1d2zb8z,Prager U Videos in Public Middle School Science Class?,"My kid told me today that his science teacher showed them a video from Prager U in science class (7th grade), and not in the way where it was being shown as a rebuttal or counter argument or alternative facts sort of way, but in the 'this is the truth' sort of way.  I know Prager U videos are being heralded as a solution but it's mostly the south (Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana, Florida) but I had no idea this was acceptable curriculum here in Michigan public schools.  Has anyone come across this sort of thing here in MI?  If so, what's a reasonable course of action to take?  How do I make sure that this right-wing """"free alternative to the dominant left-wing ideology"""" edutainment isn't being used as factual curriculum in school here?

EDIT / UPDATE:

Update from the teacher on my previous ‘PragerU’ post

Ok so i made a post earlier this week that had A TON of discussion (informative, helpful, hateful, and in between). First I must say how immensely grateful i am for the following:
- I live in a state now that has amazing people 
- the mods of this forum are totally on top of things and seem to do a great job at what they do (probably entirely unpaid)
- even in a rural community in the middle of nowhere that we have great teachers (oceana county). 

All this said, I got a reply back from a carefully crafted message to the teacher. I essentially asked for more information regarding the use of certain seemingly ‘right-wing’ or ‘propagandist’ or entirely outdated materials in the classroom. A lot of what you (Reddit) responded with informed my message and really made it make sense without being accusatory, inflammatory, or presumptuous. 

Just so you all know, the PragerU content was not the first issue I had, it was the last straw before taking some action. There were other ‘red flags’ before I decided to make the original post here or write the teacher. 

Before I posted here or sent the email to the teacher I learned about and reviewed the following materials that were presented in class:

- at least one video from PragerU (Love the Earth? Save Our Trees?) 
- several videos by John Stossel (Tampering with Nature, Myths Lies and Downright Stupidity 4 (the DDT portion)
- the chapter from this book from the Fraser Institute regarding climate change (I don’t recall exactly what chapter it was): Facts Not Fear; A Parent’s Guide to Teaching Children About the Environment

Here’s what the teacher wrote me back:

__________________________
Within the roughly 4-5 weeks we cover the environment, I spend about two weeks going over chapter 15 in the textbook (published, 2003). After that, we go through the same topics again using videos, discussion, Facts Not Fear, google slides, etc. One main goal is to show students that progress has been made in many areas (such as cleaner air and water according to the EPA) in the United States thanks to laws, human awareness, etc. 

The point of going over some “outdated” videos and books is to show how things in the past have changed scientifically and we now know certain predictions/assumptions made back in the day were sometimes right and sometimes wrong. The parts of the old Facts Not Fear that I skim over here and there are sometimes irrelevant to what year it is and if it is relevant, new data is presented. For example the ‘climate science’ you referenced was followed up by graphs of temperature change, the ozone thinning, etc. right up to 2022 or so (from NASA and other trusted organizations). 

Another concept is helping them understand that there are trade-offs when making decisions in life and to look at both sides of an issue before making a judgment. For example, it would be great to get rid of using fossil fuel tomorrow to make the environment cleaner. However, it is also important they learn the benefits crude oil has given us to make our lives much better (over 6,000 uses besides gas at the pump). Informing them on how recycling is a great thing was covered too (such as scrap metal, pop cans and cardboard) but in some cases it isn’t a good idea due to cost and more net pollution. As for the DDT video, yes there has been progress in countries with malaria before and after that video was made. The intention wasn’t to claim progress hasn’t been made, or chemicals are always safe. 

Concerning the two PragerU videos the intent again is showing different perspectives whether someone agrees with it or not. I do use John Stossel a lot because his videos are short, keep kids interested and tend to show both sides (although because of a lack of time this year I didn’t get in very much).  My big picture with this unit (a required state standard) is to show the strengths and weaknesses of a topic via trade offs/two sides. Really in any area of life. 

Thanks for reaching out and expressing your concerns,

Have a great weekend.
——————————————

So all this said, I am glad I took my concerns to the teacher first and didn’t just go ‘guns blazing’ to the school board or the news or anyone else. I have met with this teacher a number of times already (in parent teacher conferences, and at track meets, etc) and never got the feeling right off the bat that there was some crazy stuff going on, but you just never know. 

In any case, I promised an update when I had one, and now I have it, so I wanted to let you all know what was up. Seriously, to all my fellow Redditors, peace and love and thanks again.

The whole place is shabby, run down, and litter was everywhere, with trash cans overflowing and not attended to well before noon. The port-a-johns were a shitshow (literally).

Looking into the vendor stands and shops was nearly impossible, because the place was so overcrowded that the flow of people made it difficult to stand still to window shop- you just got moved along with the crowd. Besides that, most of the shops are so small, that you have to hustle to get in and out so you can make room for the next group of people clamoring to get inside.

Minnesota,1emmvr0,"For our friends trying to Swiftboat Governor Walz for leaving after """"only 24 years"""" of service in the national guard","Conservatives, including VP candidate JD Vance, have decided it's a good strategy to attack Walz's 24 years of service in the Army National Guard as cowardly, or """"stolen valor"""" because Walz retired in May 2005, before the 125th Artillery was deployed to Iraq. 

JD Vance answered the call to go to Iraq, whereas Walz """"left his unit hanging"""" after learning of the upcoming deployment. 

I think there's just one small wrinkle in this story. 

Walz retired on May 16, 2005 to focus on his run for congress where was a passionate advocate for veterans assistance. 

[The 125th Artillery received its alert orders for deployment in July 2005, **two months later.**](https://www.nationalguard.mil/News/Article/573070/guard-unit-recognized-for-record-deployment/)


I'm seeing a lot of articles just take at face value that the order of events is opposite. That Walz's unit received orders *before* he retired in May. The only source I could find with a clear date for those orders indicates it was in July. 

Good luck with that one, swiftboaters!

Update:

[Some new articles have come out with more detail,](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/07/politics/tim-walz-military-record-vance-attack?cid=ios_app) Walz:


- Filed to run for congress February 10, 2005
- The unit received some indication in March 2005 for a """"possible deployment to Iraq within two years""""
- The Walz campaign issued a statement in March 2005:

>“I do not yet know if my artillery unit will be part of this mobilization and I am unable to comment further on specifics of the deployment... 

>As Command Sergeant Major I have a responsibility not only to ready my battalion for Iraq, but also to serve if called on. I am dedicated to serving my country to the best of my ability, whether that is in Washington DC or in Iraq...

>I don’t want to speculate on what shape my campaign will take if I am deployed, but I have no plans to drop out of the race. I am fortunate to have a strong group of enthusiastic supporters and a very dedicated and intelligent wife. Both will be a major part of my campaign, whether I am in Minnesota or Iraq.

- Retired from the National Guard in May 2005, wishing to focus on his run for congress, and a reference to concerns over the Hatch Act. 

- Exact date of Walz's retirement paper submittal is unclear. 

- Alert orders issued on July 14, 2005.

Minnesota,1euj0ik,"I love my """"failed state""""","Mr. Trump says we are a failed State.  I love living here...been here my whole life of 50+ years.  Been to many other States, but Minnesota is my home...and nowhere else!!

**Is the State perfect?**  No, but no State is.

**Do I agree with our politicians?**  Not always, but no one ever does in any State.

**Do we have crime?**  Of course we do, but so does every other State.

**Are people making a mass exodus from Minnesota?**  Based upon the number of houses and apartments being built, that appears doubtful.

**Is road construction a pain in the rear?**  Absolutely it is, but after driving nearly 3,000 miles in 7 States in the last two weeks, I am thankful for all the road construction we have - we have awesome roads compared to other places.

Minnesota ranks high on many good lists, and some bad.  But all States can claim that, too.

The people here are genuinely awesome.  We have bountiful nature, great restaurants, various entertainment options, and a history worth learning. I am sure others have ideas of what makes this State great.

Every state in its history has had bad moments...ours happened to be in 2020.  That does not make us a failed State, just an imperfect one.

Failure is not a bad thing - failure helps us to learn, grow, and improve - and I feel the State and local governments are trying to do that despite extremely tough headwinds.

I hope others love this """"failed State"""" as well.",1723904866,1067,https://www.reddit.com/r/minnesota/comments/1euj0ik/i_love_my_failed_state/,258,Foreign-Trifle1865,,,Crime and Law Enforcement,359.6,2288.6

Mississippi,1aci1km,"Misconception and answers about """"illegals"""" in Mississippi.","After seeing a popular thread about “illegals” in Mississippi blow up. There seems to be a few misconceptions about “illegals” So, I want to clear up the mystery. 

1. Most aren’t Hispanic. They are indigenous, specifically, Mam. Hispanic is a confusing term because it is an umbrella term for everyone in Latin and Central America. However, many people are mixed with indigenous and european blood. There are people with different cultures that are stuck together in one term: “Hispanic” 
2. The Mam people have their own culture differently. [They have traditional dresses call Corte. ](https://imgur.com/a/z2nU6bP)They speak a different language, called Mam. They have traditional festivals, like choosing a princess. Though, Mam is dying language. More kids are learning Spanish and English than Mam. 
3. Companies are to blame for lowering wages. Why did they move south? To get out of the union plants. Why did they hire “illegals”? To pay less than an American worker. 
4. Guatemala is poor. Many indigenous villages and cities are a lot poorer. [Partially due to the attempted Genocide against the indigenous population during the Guatemala Civil War. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemalan_genocide)That is why many indigenous go to America. To help their relatives affected by the war
5. Mississippi requires E-verify. Why does the state not enforce it? Oh wait, they probably lobby by the plants to keep it lowkey.[ It has been known for years. ](https://jp.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-koch-foods-idUSKCN1UZ1OV/)
6. After the whole charade of the plants raid. Most “illegals” keep it lowkey. After a few weeks, most find different jobs in different plants. I know who got hired with no papers. Companies love to hire illegal workers. 

There are many more but I want to get out some big misconceptions. I live in and around Central MS, where most of """"illegals"""" live. If you need any more questions. Ask me.

Reproductive rights in Mississippi are in desperate need of our support.   
  
In 2022, the Supreme Court overturned Roe vs. Wade which triggered an abortion ban in the state of Mississippi and put thousands of lives at stake across the country. In Mississippi, those who need reproductive services have few options. While women can still travel out of state to obtain services, which some do, travel isn't an option for the majority.   
  
Organizations are working tirelessly in Mississippi to support those needing access to care and resources. If you can help, consider donating to the following organizations:   
  
The Mississippi Freedom Fund - this organization offers financial assistance and practical support to persons seeking abortion. They also provide free emergency contraception, and community-based comprehensive sex education, while fighting for reproductive justice in Mississippi.    
  
You can donate here: [https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/mrff](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/mrff)   
  
Mississippi in Action - this organization uses a holistic approach and focuses on supporting groups and individuals through advocacy, education, navigation, and referrals.   
  
Follow and support them here: msinaction   
  
Arc Southeast supports people seeking abortion care in the Southeast through funding and logistical support. Their mission is to help Southerners access safe and compassionate healthcare services.   
You can support them here: [https://arc-southeast.org/donate/](https://arc-southeast.org/donate/)

Mississippi,1gdsipg,Work trip in Jackson,"Hi! 24F, just had a four day work trip in Jackson and had to commute everyday to a small town an hour outside of Jackson. 

I just wanted to say how much I enjoyed my work trip. I’m a native Texan, and have to travel a lot for work. This year, I’ve been sent a lot to the east coast, and finally got sent on a work trip to the south. 

Coming from Texas, (driving south from Jackson), y’all are some pretty good drivers. NO ONE rode up my butt, in fact, I admitted to myself that I was driving too fast because of my Texas driving habits. I could actually go the speed limit. I adore all the beautiful trees that lined the roads, and just the backroads were so peaceful. 

I realized how much I missed true southern hospitality. At the small town I was working in, I found a coffee shop, and asked the two baristas if they had some nail salon recs, and we ended up talking for 15 minutes. 

I ended up getting my nails done in Jackson, and it was such a pleasure to get my nails done in a REAL salon, not one of those gimmicky “aesthetic” ones. This one, was only three ladies working, by appointment, and everyone was chatting and laughing, and singing to the music playing. Felt like a scene out of steel magnolias or something. 

The salon was humble but immaculate. The manicurist took her time on my nails, and was amazing. My french gel manicure was only $45 and looks phenomenal. Where I’m from, all the salons have at least 20 tables and at least 10 pedicure chairs, and you feel just like another number, and it’s not a relaxing experience. Oh, and a simple gel manicure, without french, will cost you $80. Without tip. 

I ate some bombbbb food, in Jackson and out in the country. Had some really good Ramen, Jamaican, and Soul food. Still thinking about the burger I got from a food truck out in the country, it was so simple, but so so good. Your girl had lots of food options!

I enjoyed taking the long way and seeing beautiful porches, heck I even waved to a older lady in her rocking chair, (like I’m some local or something lol). TSA and the airline worker who checked in my bag were even pleasant!!! 

I will be volunteering myself for more work trips in Mississippi, y’all some good, hardworking people! ",1730084780,182,https://www.reddit.com/r/mississippi/comments/1gdsipg/work_trip_in_jackson/,18,dratinimartini69,,,Health,91,202.3

In the six days that we drove around, we counted seven Trump signs. I found this very surprising, as when we were there in 2020, we pretty much made the same circuit because we come back every year to visit our favorite places and attend our family reunions, and there were LOTS of Trump signs.

Missouri,1dkyruu,Missouri woman poison’s her neighbors trees to get a better view of the ocean,"Kit Bonds family poisoned their neighbors trees in Maine to obtain an unobstructed view of the ocean. The poison has spread to the beach which is the only public seaside beach. 

Tebuthiuron contaminates soil and doesn’t break down, so it continues to kill plants. At Auburn University, it took the removal of about 1,780 tons (1,615 metric tons) of contaminated material to achieve negligible levels of the chemical in the soil.

Short of removing the soil, the only other solution is dilution — waiting for nature to thin out the concentration of the herbicide to safe levels for plants. It could take six months to two years for it to be diluted enough to no longer endanger to plants, said Scott McElroy, an Auburn professor specializing in weed science and herbicide chemistry.

Missouri,1b8zs69,National conservative groups are working to limit transgender rights. They’re finding success in Missouri," Missouri may offer a prime example of a red state primed for plug-and-play laws restricting transgender rights.

A robust network of conservative advocacy groups stretching across the country has eagerly seized the chance to show the Show Me State just how to do that.

Last year, lawmakers passed a ban on access to gender-affirming care for minors and another law effectively shutting transgender athletes out of girls’ and women’s sports. Since then, more bills reining in a range of LGBTQ rights have been introduced by a Republican-dominated General Assembly eager to accommodate voters.

Now, with elections looming and a veto-proof supermajority,  ambitious Republican politicians are homing in on the issue with what critics describe as a “firehose of anti-trans legislation.”

Missouri,1cq87ny,"Missouri illegally denied food assistance to low-income residents, federal court rules","A federal judge ruled Thursday that Missouri’s Department of Social Services has been illegally denying tens of thousands of residents access to food assistance benefits.

Due to extremely long wait times at the DSS call center, many eligible residents are unable to get help applying or schedule interviews, which the state requires in order for applicants to qualify for assistance.

“The evidence is undisputed that the telephone system utilized by DSS to handle SNAP applications is overwhelmed,” wrote federal judge Douglas Harpool of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri. “The evidence reflects unacceptable wait times and thousands of calls that cannot be completed.”

The Kansas City-based food bank Harvesters helps residents apply for SNAP benefits, also known as food stamps. The group’s policy adviser Karen Siebert told The Star that some clients reported waiting on hold for hours to speak with DSS, including those on prepaid phone plans who got disconnected when their limited minutes expired.

“We would definitely hear from applicants that we were helping that they were not getting responses from the state,” she said. “We would hear their frustrations, but we’re not in a place to do anything about it.”

Missouri,1cb4vsu,"2008 Presidential Election in Missouri results. 49.36% (McCain) 49.23% (Obama). A difference of just 3,903 votes!","The 2008 United States presidential election in Missouri was held on November 4, 2008, and was part of the 2008 United States presidential election, which took place throughout all 50 states and D.C. Voters chose 11 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.

Missouri was won by Republican nominee John McCain by 3,903 votes, a 0.13% margin of victory. Prior to the election, most news organizations considered this state a toss-up, or a swing state. On election day, Missouri was the closest state in 2008, with most news organizations not calling the state until two weeks after the election. A high turnout of voters in the GOP strongholds of Greene County (Springfield) and St. Charles County, combined with Democrat Barack Obama's lackluster performance in the more rural parts of the state, gave the edge to McCain. Since the margin of victory was less than 1%, Obama could have legally called for a recount at no expense to himself, but he ultimately chose not to do so. This was likely because he had already received enough electoral votes to win the presidency which rendered Missouri's 11 electoral votes inconsequential and a recount would have been unlikely to change the outcome.

Obama became the first Democrat to ever win the presidency without carrying Missouri, and McCain the first Republican to carry Missouri without winning the presidency. Combined with the state's swing to the right in 2000 and 2004 and the further bleeding of Democratic support in white, rural areas, this would be the last time when Missouri was seriously contested and considered to be a swing/bellwether state. The state continued moving deeper and safer into the Republican side four years later and onward, and as such, this is the most recent election when the Republican candidate won less than 50% of the state's popular vote. As of 2020, this is the last time that Iron County, Jefferson County, Washington County, Ste. Genevieve County, and Buchanan County voted for the Democratic candidate. Despite losing, Obama's 1,441,911 votes are the most received by a Democratic presidential candidate in the state's history. This remains the last election where Missouri voted to the left of Georgia and Arizona.

Missouri,1esbbzw,"Missouri judge allows ballot language banning voting by non-citizens, a practice already against the law","JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (KY3) - Late Monday, Cole County Judge Cotton Walker issued a ruling in a case challenging a ballot question that will be put before voters on November 5.

The question contains two main provisions. The first bans non-citizen voting in Missouri elections, which is already impossible under state and federal law. The voting provision precedes a ban on voting systems commonly referred to as “ranked choice voting.”

The question, which the court ultimately ruled is fair and accurate, asked Missouri voters whether they wanted to:

Make the Constitution consistent with state law by only allowing citizens of the United States to vote
Prohibit the ranking of candidates by limiting voters to a single vote per candidate or issue
Require the plurality winner of a political party primary to be the single candidate at a general election
Notably, when asked in court whether non-citizens can currently vote in Missouri, attorneys defending the ballot language would not give a definitive answer
“.The court doubts whether the defendants or their counsel actually believe that non-citizens are currently allowed to vote,” Walker wrote in his judgment. “In fact, Missouri currently has statutes that prohibit non-citizens from voting in public elections.”

The lawsuit, brought by two Missouri voters, argued that because the ballot question failed to inform voters that non-citizens are already not allowed to vote, it is fundamentally misleading.

Walker determined that the ballot language “is not untrue or partial, and it does not use language that is intentionally argumentative or likely to create prejudice for the measure nor does it incorrectly describe SJR78.”

Montana,1g7gddy,Thank you!,"Dear Montanans,
This is going to be a little longer...
I've been on a road trip through your beautiful Treasure State with my girlfriend back in September and it has changed my life for the better.

The trip was originally planned in 2020 as part of a full road trip through the western part of America, but 4 days before we were to leave, the first lockdown canceled our plans. This year we both managed to get 3 weeks of vacation, so we decided to go for it. Since we like to enjoy our time in nature, we decided to spend all our time in Montana and Wyoming and skip the West Coast completely. 

In July and August I had a pretty rough time at work. Too many projects and crappy clients brought me to the brink of a burnout.
A few days before our departure I decided to quit my job for the sake of my health. In all this chaos my mood for the trip was almost 0, but there was no turning back and since I didn't want to ruin my girls' vacation I tried my best to stay positive...

After 18 hours of traveling we finally arrived in Bozeman and from that point on things changed completely.
From day one, the incredible beauty of this place touched my heart and healed my soul. In addition, the kindness of you Montanans made our trip so special, there was always a helping hand when needed and we were welcomed with open arms. We always felt at home…

I will be forever grateful for this experience.

Now, 4 weeks after we arrived back in Austria, there is not a single day we don't dream about our time in the U.S. I hope we can come back sometime and maybe stay forever. Until then, please keep this beautiful place as amazing as it is and please never change your way of life.

Thank you!",1729365410,936,https://i.redd.it/ptxp0lx8jrvd1.jpeg,41,Horror_Ruin_5027,https://storage.googleapis.com/policy_posse_reddit_images/reddit_post_images/1g7gddy.jpg,https://storage.googleapis.com/policy_posse_reddit_images/reddit_post_images/1g7gddy.jpg,Health,47.3,222

Montana,1f4ycim,A Resting Spot for Fairies,"I am not a small person. At 6’4”, it’s not easy to get down on the ground, or to get back on my feet again! My name literally means “small”.  I’ve always smiled at the humor in that, but perhaps the meaning rings true in that I readily notice the little things. Don’t get me wrong, I do love the grand landscapes that Montana has to offer, but I cherish the tiny scenes that would be easy to trample with my big ol’ feet. I saunter through the forest very carefully so as not to disturb the miniature landscapes far below me. I often walk smack dab into spider webs because I am always looking down. Pro-tip: if we’re ever walking through the woods together, walk behind me and you’ll never have to worry about webs in your face! Anyway, back to the tiny, underfoot land of mushrooms and fairies. 

I was wandering through the woods the other day, near Swan Creek in the Gallatin Mountain Range. Now, I have never seen a fairy, but I suspect they’ve seen me!  The same wind that chased the clouds across the sky, had the pine trees swaying with mesmerizing motions. The gentle roar of a gust would start faintly in the distance and then crescendo above me before softly disappearing into the woods. I was wondering at the play of light and shadows that all of this arial drama created on the forest floor, when I spotted this delightful scene near the tip of my boot. A small tilted flat stone sloped towards a mushroom that was about 2 inches tall. Just enough height to offer a forest fairy shelter from either rain or bright sunlight. In fact, I’m not so certain that the rustling I heard in the long mosses wasn’t a fairy or two making sure I meant them no harm. 

I placed my camera gently on the ground, taking care not to crush any plants. I propped the lens up a bit with a small segment of tree branch laying nearby. I immediately noticed the shadow of the mushroom being cast onto the rock. A bit of warm sunlight was being transferred through the cap and onto the gills underneath. Another bit of sunlight snuck around the cap and cut across the stem of the mushroom before settling onto the rock. In the background, an ephemeral shaft of light, illuminated the background and drove my imagination crazy wondering if I’d heard fairy music and soft giggling or just the song of a distant warbler along the creek bank. The next moment, the light had changed, and the magic moved on to another location in the forest.",1725032322,96,https://i.redd.it/duhkc41rmtld1.jpeg,5,SingingSkyPhoto,https://storage.googleapis.com/policy_posse_reddit_images/reddit_post_images/1f4ycim.jpg,https://storage.googleapis.com/policy_posse_reddit_images/reddit_post_images/1f4ycim.jpg,Defense and National Security,47.3,222

Montana,1fmzotr,The Dream Machine,"During the night, the heavy clouds of a departing storm began to dissipate. As the Sun approached from below the eastern horizon, vapor began to rise from the surface of the river. A gentle breeze scooped it up and carried it lovingly as it sauntered through the cottonwoods lining the water’s edge. The fog didn’t get too thick. Not quite a blanket, it was more like a silky shawl embracing the landscape. The lower branches of the trees and shrubs became frosted in feathers of ice. Soon, the energy of our favorite star began to illuminate the landscape.  

The river had been up to some mischief! With the air temp near zero, slushy ice formed wherever the water was disturbed. Riffles caused by submerged stones helped introduce frigid air to the super-cooled water. In one particular area, faster water enters a region of more still water.  Shelves of solid ice along the shores created an area with a back-current. Flowing ice was lured in and molded into a perfectly spinning circle. It was like a gear in a dream machine. The dream it created is obscurely reflected in the downstream pool. 

Meanwhile, clouds danced overhead competing with the motion of the river for my attention. These ephemeral ice phenomena are fantastic things to observe. The soft scrape of slush against ice made for a soundtrack that was as magical to my ears as the ice circle was to my eyes.  Then, in just moments, the clouds passed, the circle ceased movement as it jammed against the shelf ice, and the moment vanished the way a dream in the night gives way to the reality of day. It was a good dream. Reality wasn’t that bad either.

Montana,1clbav9,PSA: Idaho would like you to know that I90 through the panhandle is messy... again.,"Hey, I know this isn't quite about Montana, but I know that lots of Western Montanans come through to do medical stuff in Coeur 'D Alene and Spokane. Road Construction is upon us again, and it's probably a wise idea to give yourself at least an 30 extra minutes to get through the Idaho Panhandle because it's absolutely necessary to slow down.

Some trouble spots you should probably know about:

East of Kellogg is one lane. It started in Osburn, last I drove it,, which is about a ten miles stretch. However, the seeming end of construction west of Kellogg is naught but wishful thinking. Going towards Cataldo you will find yourself contending with the tyranny of Orange cones again in short order. Please don't try to take the five mile stretch of two lanes between Kellogg and the start of the cones at top speed to pick up time, it won't work and when you turn around the bend and see a single lane again it will just be a regrettable waste of gas.

Right now the Westbound portion of 4th of July doesn't have as much construction as the eastbound lanes, but of course the single lane is the steep section, and you WILL get behind some heavy truck doing 25.  Once you are headed down, it's free flowing until you are West of CDA, at which point the section around the exit 7 rest stop is again having some sort of work done.

Speaking of Eastbound, between the top of the pass and the single lane section, there are some seriously terrible ruts between the two lanes. Hit them fast enough and you will crack your teeth. I don't know why they aren't included in the construction (it starts less than a mile away from the big ruts) but here we are.

As usual, it seems like clogs mostly form in the Eastbound traffic in the afternoon, so if you have to drive then, you may want to give yourself as much as an hour buffer. Even late at night it took me an extra 15-20 minutes to get through the Panhandle west to east.

In neither direction is there really a good place to pick up a little speed and catch up your schedule, so please give yourself enough time to get through.

Montana,1ewgj2c,Resistance is Futile,"Just as relentless gravity pulls water down the creek, I am drawn with no less vigor by the power my imagination has over me to wander down this gravel road. In Wendell Berry’s essay, A Native Hill, he shares these thoughts on the difference between a road and a path. 

“The difference between a path and a road is not only the obvious one. A path is little more than a habit that comes with knowledge of a place. It is a sort of ritual of familiarity. As a form, it is a form of contact with a known landscape. It is not destructive. It is the perfect adaptation, through experience and familiarity, of movement to place; it obeys the natural contours; such obstacles as it meets it goes around.”

By this definition and despite my mode of transportation, this road is much more of a path. My knowledge of this place has not dimmed my sense of wonder for it. Even though I know by loving memory what view may appear around the next corner, I am drawn inexorably to experience it again. Wendell proposes that roads resist the landscape and wish to avoid contact with it. Not so with this primitive road. It chooses to embrace the landscape as it carries my love for wild places and starry night skies deeper into the terrain. I’m not sure why anyone would resist the pull of any type of path that carries them away from hurry and towards the solace the natural world has to offer.

Life and Death Under the Stars

The struggle is real when it comes to life and death in Yellowstone. The beauty of places like our National Parks is that even in death, there is ethereal serenity about it. There is artistry in the harshness of life in the natural world and in the inevitable death that follows. The circle of life moves at varying speeds here. Sometimes an animal meets it's demise in moments at the teeth of a predator. The sustenance provided as one creature gives its life to feed another is prompt. Other times, a Lodgepole Pine blows over and takes decades to return to the soil. The nutrients that the tree took so many years to absorb from the earth, take decades to return to the soil to give life to a myriad of other living things. The thing I really love about the wilderness that encompasses so much of my part of the world and the universe of stars above it, is that time seems to slow down when I’m out here. In fact, if it weren’t for the ever so slight movement of the stars as they slide across the heavens, and the faint flickering of the Northern Lights to the left, I might not be aware of time at all.

Nebraska,1fh2emg,Love v. Ricketts,"This ad came and went so quick I almost missed it during the Husker game. I thought it had to be a parody or joke. Apparently an outside group bought one TV commercial for Preston Love Jr's race against Pete Ricketts for the Senate seat open since Ben Sasse left.

According to the good people at the Nebraska Examiner:

LINCOLN — Nebraska’s unexpected U.S. Senate race is getting a small jolt of outside spending from a progressive SuperPAC tied to former Omaha-area U.S. House candidate Kara Eastman.

Cavalry PAC is buying a single statewide TV ad this week, helped by $100,000 in donations from University of Nebraska Regent Barbara Weitz and $20,000 from her daughter, Katie. Eastman helps run the PAC with news commentator Cenk Uygur, who is known for co-hosting the online show “The Young Turks.”

The group has spent $35,000 on an ad for Democrat Preston Love Jr. to run on cable and streaming services during the Saturday football game between the Huskers and Northern Iowa on the Big Ten Network. 

The ad supports Love’s candidacy against Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, who was appointed to the seat by Gov. Jim Pillen after former Sen. Ben Sasse resigned to lead the University of Florida.

Pete Ricketts makes it official, files for U.S. Senate bid

Eastman, an upstart candidate when she first ran in 2018, said her group is investing in a candidate who isn’t getting as much support from the typical Democratic Party donors or party establishment.

Preston Love Jr. compares campaign to David in challenging a Goliath named Ricketts

“Preston Love Jr. is a phenomenal candidate,” she said of the North Omaha civil rights activist. “When you’re up against a billionaire like Ricketts, it’s really hard to compete.”

Love had raised $164,000 as of the end of June and listed $6,500 in campaign cash on hand. Ricketts had raised $4.3 million and listed $1.7 million in cash on hand.

The ad features child actors meant to look like a young Love and a young Ricketts. It shows young Love character talking about wanting to play football for the Huskers and making his community better.

The young Ricketts character says he’ll use “daddy’s money” to take away women’s rights and reach the Senate. 

Jessica Flanagain, a political consultant for the Ricketts campaign, said in response to the ad, “Senator Ricketts has been elected by Nebraskans statewide twice and will be again in November. Regarding this childishness – if a tree falls in a forest and nobody hears it….”

EDITOR’S NOTE: This story has been corrected to show that individual members of the Weitz family, not the Weitz Family Foundation, made donations to Cavalry PAC.",1726367529,159,https://youtu.be/IGoXxkNUq0A?feature=shared,18,number151,,,Health,90,271

Nevada,1efypw9,City vs State Jobs vs SNWA... any employees chime in?,"Good afternoon! I recently became interested in State jobs in several different departments after the Veterans hiring event. After searching around, I found local jobs (City of Henderson) that look like they would be a good fit also. These would be entry level jobs, some are part time with PERS, some without. A lot of the language is confusing to an outsider of course.

The end goal would be benefits/retirement even if that requires transferring positions after a number of years. I'm currently a Teamster also, and I see some of the city jobs are a different local (Teamsters 14). I'm not sure if any of that would translate over as far as benefits/seniority/retirement.

Has anyone worked at the State and/or local City level? Any glaring differences or pros/cons? I am coming from a 19 year career with no work/life balance and would like to find an employer that will be my last until retirement. Just want to make the best informed choice.

Oh... and also curious as to how someone would get on with the SNWA/LVVWD? I've been to the large treatment plants Richard Bunker and Alfred Morris. I'm not sure if they are through a city or state entity? I do have water reclamation/treatment experience and interestingly enough our hobby YouTube channel is based around Lake Mead and the Las Vegas water situation.

THANKS IN ADVANCE 🤠

**\*\*\*UPDATE 10/2024\*\*\***  
I went for LVVWD and City jobs first as recommended. I had a couple outright rejections and a couple """"qualified but not among the most qualified."""" I take this with optimism that I might qualify for something in the future! I only applied to positions where I actually felt I had some combination of the required experience.

Nevada,1g1fen3,Alternate Realities,"Just ended a friendship over them explaining to me (who’s working in the field) that weather is being manipulated and hurricanes are a direct result of cloud seeding.

Now here’s my question to you fellow Nevadans - how can we as a people overcome this rift that seemingly creates two completely separate realities; one in which we are doing the best we can, and one in which everyone is conspiring with everything to make the world a worse place for personal gain? 

I’m just really frustrated dealing with disinformation and lies on a daily basis. So I suppose a different way to ask the same subject is: what does it take for you individually to believe, reject, or know something?

New Hampshire's ALEC politicians:  
[https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/New\_Hampshire\_ALEC\_Politicians](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/New_Hampshire_ALEC_Politicians)



**ALEC is not a lobby; it is not a front group. It is much more powerful than that.** Through ALEC, behind closed doors, corporations hand state legislators the changes to the law they desire that directly benefit their bottom line. Corporations fund almost all of ALEC's operations. Participating legislators, overwhelmingly conservative Republicans, then bring those proposals home and introduce them in statehouses across the land as their own brilliant ideas and important public policy innovations—without disclosing that corporations crafted and voted on the bills.

**More than 98% of ALEC's revenues come from sources other than legislative dues, such as corporations, corporate trade groups, and corporate foundations.** Each corporate member pays an annual fee of between $7,000 and $25,000 a year, and if a corporation participates in any of the nine task forces, additional fees apply, from $2,500 to $10,000 each year. ALEC also receives direct grants from corporations, such as $1.4 million from ExxonMobil from 1998-2009. It has also received grants from some of the biggest foundations funded by corporate CEOs in the country, such as: the Koch family [Charles G. Koch Foundation](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Charles_G._Koch_Foundation), the Koch-managed [Claude R. Lambe Foundation](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Claude_R._Lambe_Charitable_Foundation), the [Scaife](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Scaife) family [Allegheny Foundation](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Allegheny_Foundation), the [Coors](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Coors) family [Castle Rock Foundation](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Castle_Rock_Foundation), to name a few. Less than 2% of ALEC’s funding comes from “Membership Dues” of $50 per year paid by state legislators, a steeply discounted price that may run afoul of state gift bans. 

**Why would a legislator be interested in advancing cookie-cutter bills that are corporate give-aways for global firms located outside of their district?** ALEC’s appeal rests largely on the fact that legislators receive an all-expenses-paid trip that provides many part-time legislators with vacations that they could not afford on their own, along with the opportunity to rub shoulders with wealthy captains of industry (major prospective out-of-state donors to their political campaigns). For a few hours of work on a task force and a couple of indoctrination sessions by ALEC experts, part-time legislators can bring the whole family to ALEC’s annual convention, work for a few hours, then stay in swank hotels, attend cool parties -- even [strip clubs](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/06/27/989297/-Did-ALEC-Reimburse-SC-Gov-Haley-for-Her-Strip-Club-Excursion)-- and raise funds for the campaign coffer, all heavily subsidized by the corporate till. In 2009, ALEC spent $251,873 on childcare so mom and dad could have fun.

Just coming west on 101 this afternoon it was raining cats and dogs, I had several instances of cars behind or next to me with no lights on. This is what it looks like in a trucks mirrors when a car has no lights on in the rain. 

I generally run down the road around 100,000 pounds, sometimes more sometimes a little less. I don’t really want to find out first hand what kind of damage might happen if there were an accident because a car was virtually invisible to me. 

Please, not just for me but for everyone else on the road, turn your lights on when it’s raining.

NewHampshire,18fztrt,Is it time to bring the FBI in to investigate NH Republicans?,"At a minimum, we have four Republicans at the highest levels of the New Hampshire Government who engaged in election fraud and the subsequent coverup. Before the last legislative session started, Republicans investigated themselves and concluded that **Representative Merner did not live in his district**.

[""""He (Merner) did state that he was ‘in transition’ and looking to move back to Lancaster with his wife,” Matteson wrote.""""](https://indepthnh.org/2023/12/09/3645175/)

[The email stated Merner had sold his house in Lancaster in August 2022](https://www.nhpr.org/nh-news/2023-12-08/ag-detailed-merners-inconsistent-claims-about-residency-in-email-to-top-state-house-administrator)

This is not conjecture. This does not need further investigation. This is an admission and a conclusion. The Republicans (Attorney General, and House Leadership) reached this conclusion and did NOTHING except for engage in obstruction. The Office of the AG and the Republican Party have just turned New Hampshire into a good-ole-boys backwater swamp. The entire fucking state has been disenfranchised by this conspiracy. Our laws are forever altered because the entire NH Republican organization conspired to commit fraud and obstruct justice.

These following individuals need to be investigated by an agency outside of the state and our good-ole-boy network.

1. Republican House Speaker **Sherman Packard**
2. Republican Deputy General Counsel **Myles Matteson**
3. Republican COO of the General Court **Terry Pfaff**
4. Republican Attorney General **John Michael Formella**

It's time to refer this case to the FBI, because our our own state justice system is part of the crime. The obstruction by the Attorney General and House Speaker continues today.

# [""""The Attorney General’s Office and House Speaker Sherman Packard, R-Londonderry, have refused to release the Matteson email, which first became public in a New Hampshire Public Radio report Friday night.""""](https://indepthnh.org/2023/12/09/3645175/)

NewJersey,1eo9uff,Lakewood Schools with terrible results on their State Audit,"There are some incredibly bad findings in this linked State Audit (PDF) of Lakewood School district. Some highlights below, but I recommend reading the whole thing. It's pretty damning.

**Failing to even attempt to repay loans:**

The district owes $32.6 million towards loan repayments, and its State Aid should be reduced by the same amount. 

**Conflicts of interest:**

A part-time employee of the district is also the full-time director of a contracted vendor and received total compensation of $1.1 million. 

The district has a contract with a vendor to provide transportation services to nonpublic students. From fiscal years 2019 to 2023, this vendor was paid approximately $105.9 million. The vendor’s full-time director is also a part-time district employee whose performance responsibilities include preparing all bid specifications for transportation services and receiving all nonpublic school transportation applications (B6Ts) from which payment to the vendor is derived.  

**Overcompensation:**

General Counsel received compensation of $2.4 million that was not based on hours worked. Additionally, hours for litigation services were not limited. 

Regarding litigation services, there were 22 instances billed for more than 12 hours per day totaling $150,417, with one instance billed for 21 hours in one day totaling $10,054. The contract does not limit the number of hours charged for litigation services.

 Total spending for legal services exceeded the statewide averages by an average of $1.1 million per year, or 456 percent. 

The district paid $1.3 million in overtime, of which nearly $600,000 was in excess of the efficiency threshold. 

During fiscal years 2019 through 2023, the district paid $410,816 in overtime to eight executive secretaries exempt from receiving overtime.  

In fiscal year 2020, the top earner was an executive secretary who received $102,075. This individual worked 2,042 hours of overtime in that year, or an average of 5.6 extra hours per day. 

**Segregating duties:**

Purchasing and accounts payable duties were not always segregated, leading to $384,042 in purchase orders created and paid by the same individual. 

**New Jersey First Act:**

One full-time employee worked in multiple other states for 1.8 years without an exemption. 


One of the craziest parts as well is that there's a STATE MONITOR that works in the building and has to literally approve all this stuff. 

This world has zero accountability for corruption. Everyone is literally stealing your tax dollars. No one will be punished, and nothing will change after this audit.

THIS IS AN OUTRAGE!

NewJersey,17qny4t,NJ State Election Takeaways,"\- Outside of a few deep red counties and maybe some BOE races, clearly running on a platform of anti-woke, """"parental rights,"""" Transphobia, Homophobia etc (and little else) is a failure for NJ Republicans, and backfired.

\- It seems to be more non-parents (or parents whose kids are well into adulthood)...i.e. people with no kids in school, who are the ones obsessed with """"parental rights.""""  But in large part, if you're actually a parent listening to this trash, you're thinking to yourself """"Wait, what rights don't I have exactly? I'm pretty involved in my child's school and never had any problems. How am I oppressed exactly?""""

\- Abortion/Choice wasn't even on the ballot or as much of an issue in NJ, as it was elsewhere in the nation, which has been bad for Republicans, and yet Republicans in NJ still struggled. Can you imagine how much worse they'd do if they tried to push for a state abortion ban?

\- Clearly the 2021 state GOP gains were all COVID response anger and resentment, and without that, they have little else to run on.

NewJersey,1ggobmd,Something that just happened 10 mins ago,"So I have this Halloween decoration this year that is a small (and VERY obviously fake) werewolf that makes a low quality growl and the eyes light up when you walk in front of it. It also constantly says random things like really bad Halloween jokes. 

  
Anyway, there was a toddler and some parents that came to my house (this is like 4:15 PM-ish) and the werewolf slightly jumped at the kid. He screamed and the mom ran up, took the decoration, kicked it multiple times, and then ripped the wires out and threw it. My outlet was also damaged that it had been plugged into. The kid had already rang the doorbell 3 seconds after being jumped at, so he wasn't *really* scared. I opened my door to see the mom doing this.

  
She proceeded to rip the bowl out of my hands, put the candy into the toddler's bowl, then throw the bowl. She   called 911 while SCREAMING at me and said her """"son had been physically assaulted."""" They showed up, she started screaming about what had happened. Luckily, lots of the other toddler parents were out, as they start trick or treating around 4, and saw what happened. I gave my side of the story. They immediately concluded I was in the right. The woman then screamed at and hit an officer. She was taken away in the police car and the police got the father's number. They waited with the kid for 30 mins at my house until the dad came and apologized profusely for what his wife did. 

  
So yeah. People are crazy. ",1730406732,1302,https://www.reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1ggobmd/something_that_just_happened_10_mins_ago/,161,Silent_Status9126,,,Crime and Law Enforcement,178,641.3

Of course we have lesser parts but what place doesn’t? Our neighborhoods are generally clean and the burbs tend to be diverse and great places to raise a family.

NewYork,1ayh28i,"My 2 year old nephew is dying of Acute Liver Failure, and he needs a liver transplant to survive. We desperately need your help","I’m not sure where to post but right now we are desperate. My nephew caught the flu a few days ago (even though he was vaccinated) and had to be hospitalized due to a 107.9 degree fever. Upon further testing they see that his liver enzyme count for some reason was dangerously high.

The normal enzyme count is 40. His was 17,000.

Because of that, his health rapidly declined and he is currently in the ICU. The doctors say that he’ll need a liver transplant as soon as possible, and asked if we can find possible donors.

20% of a healthy adult liver can save my nephew’s life. My entire family volunteered, but in case our liver isn’t compatible we need backups, and I’m not sure who else to reach out to.

Please, if you are willing to save my nephew’s life, please reach out to me if you would like to donate a part of your liver to him. He’s only 2 years old, he doesn’t deserve to go through all this at such a young age, but we’re trying all we can to get his life back to normal. Thank you for reading.

EDIT: His blood type is B+

EDIT 2: I’m in awe from the amount of support I’m receiving from you guys, thank you so so much to ALL of you. I am trying to respond where I can, but I’ll provide some updates here:

His enzyme count has dropped significantly, from 17000 to 7000 but it’s still high so it’s going down slowly. The doctor said that since his liver is slowly restoring back to normal, there isn’t an immediate need for a transplant yet, but if we do need one we have a donor ready who is closer to his age. If that doesn’t work, we would resort to family members (starting with his father, then me, then his other uncle, etc.) Finally, if neither of our livers are compatible, then I’d be reaching out to the volunteers here (bless all of your souls). 

I’m gonna try to reply to everyone I can, I just woke up and saw all your messages. Thank you once again, you guys are amazing.

EDIT 3: WE FOUND A MATCHING DONOR. THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND KINDNESS, THIS IS WHY NEW YORK IS THE BEST CITY! I will provide updates on his vitals in a future post (coming this week), but thank you to all who were willing to donate! Your bravery is inspiring and I will never forget your act of kindness. And another massive thank you to all who shared your support, he’s still in the hospital but let’s hope he can come home to us soon.

NewYork,1fy4q50,Horror Movies Set In New York,"With Halloween approaching, I'd share a project I've been working on for a few years, recording the locations of horror movies around the country and the world. 

I am a big fan of horror and am a weird pedantic person who likes to make lists, and while people on r/horror don't seem to be as interested in this, I figured the state subreddits might. Especially if any of you are looking for new movies to watch this month.

 [You can check out my raw data here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17xzKPtu4zeDB4JDQ-Z5E6NfJ0-zL7ZLVeI8LIUZ4sy4/edit?usp=sharing), or check out a more visually pleasing [**Letterbox list I made of New York's horror movies here.**](https://letterboxd.com/horrormoviefan8/list/horror-movies-set-in-new-york/)

Now to be clear about my methodology in how I organize these movies. These are organized by where they are *SET* not necessarily by where they are *SHOT*. Example: Most of the Friday the 13th movies are not shot in NJ, but they are all classified as set in NJ because in-universe that is where they take place. In cases where the film's setting is not outright stated, I used context clues such as license plates, driver's licenses, newspapers, references to cities, and so on. While I did take into account where the movie was filmed, I tried not to use that as definitive evidence (there is a reason why the tropes [California Doubling](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaliforniaDoubling) and the [Mountains of Illinois](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMountainsOfIllinois) exist).

[I go into more of the breakdown of movies in this post on ](https://old.reddit.com/r/horror/comments/1ft95ne/horror_movie_atlas_year_6_horror_from_around_the/)r/horror if you are interested.

I have recorded 404 horror movies set in New York, placing the state at #2 in state rankings

According to IMDB, this makes the top 15 New York horror movies:

1. [Black Swan (2010)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0947798/)
2. [Rosemary's Baby (1968)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063522/)
3. [King Kong (1933)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0024216/)
4. [The Fall of the House of Usher (2023)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15567174/)
5. [Ghostbusters (1984)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087332/?ref_=wl_li_tt)
6. [Get Out (2017)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5052448/)
7. [The Legend of Sleepy Hollow (1949)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051850/)
8. [Wait Until Dark (1967)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062467/)
9. [American Psycho (2000)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0144084/)
10. [Saw (2004)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387564/)
11. [Seconds (1966)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060955/)
12. [A Quiet Place (2018)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6644200/)
13. [The Devil's Advocate (1997)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118971/)
14. [Jacob's Ladder (1990)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099871/?ref_=ttls_li_tt)

NewYork,18ylwe9,FYI some asshat pulled a bunch of the emergency brakes on the northbound 1 train around 79th street. Station currently blocked.,"Wife just messaged me, apparently some dude went through a bunch of the cars and pulled the emergency brakes. Apparently it broke the train and they can't get it moving at the moment. She has to re-route back down to 72 and then back up to ~~86th~~  (see edit) 96th. I assuming this is going to cause lots of delays today.

Edit: just informed the 1 is blocked from 72nd to 96th.

edit 2 (plus minor edit 2.1, they actually didn't catch him.) She thinks the person who did it looked like they had some sort of mental illness. One person, just talking to her now they didn't catch him unfortunately. After pulling all the brakes he ran off the train. 

edit 3: Apparently this caused a derailment up the line also, train collided with ~~the work train sent to push my wife's train out of the way~~ (see edit below) (24 injured): 

https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/subway-derailment-manhattan-upper-west-side/5006930/ 

https://go.citizen.com/0fgNp3nU5Fb


edit 4: ~~It's a bit unclear what train caused the derailment.~~ Initial news said it was work train, but listening to the news now they are saying that it was my wife's train that was struck. Sounds like they got her train moving (only 4 employees left on board, they evacuated it) and it was somehow struck around 96th street.

>The investigation is in its preliminary stages. Davey said the out-of-service train was vandalized by having its emergency cords pulled as a possible prank and all the cords, except one, had been reset. While the workers were resetting that train's cords, a transit official tells NBC New York """"it came back to life"""" and started moving despite a red stop signal, leading to the collision with the passing in-service passenger train.

NewYork,18p7fdg,Help out a local 20 years old Chinatown Business,"Hi Everyone!

I want to share a family-owned a authentic cheap Fuzhounese restaurant that has been around at Chinatown for over 20 years now. It's frustrating to see how my parents are keeping this business alive while funding me for college. We are located at 67 E Broadway New York, NY 10002 and my recommendations are

Wonton Soup $3.25

Peanut Noodles $3.50

Fried Taro Cake $1.50

Potato Meet ball $5

If you're ever near Chinatown please drop by! It's less than $10 per person and it would be the most authentic Fuzhounese food!

Edited - thank you so much everyone for the love and support. Unfortunately I will be leaving in a week for college so I wouldn’t be available to create any content. I have reached out to many local organizations and are in contact with some. We truly appreciate the support and please feel free to DM me if you have any questions.

Just created a tiktok and Instagram. - @shuimeicafe

NorthCarolina,1gdjrwm,Weird NC GOP,"
It's not just Mark Robinson and Michele Morrow that are weird.

If you're on Instagram, follow Anderson Clayton (andibreeze) - she's the Chair of the NC Democratic Party (youngest in the country!) and is a delight to listen to.  She just shared the website weirdncgop.com that tells you everything you need to know about the weird GOP candidates that are running in NC this year, especially down-ballot people that you might not know a lot about.  Some highlights:

* Hal Weatherman (running for Lieutenant Governor) mocks and blames women who have been raped, also uses the N-word.

* Luke Farley (running for Commissioner of Labor): one of his main campaign platform items is ‘Making Elevators Great Again'. He’s also called heat protections for workers “climate alarmism,” making excuses for companies to keep workers on the job without guarantees of shade or water in 100°+ heat.

* Dan Bishop (running for Attorney General): is an election-denier and says that the LGBT movement jeopardizes freedom and compares LGBTQ+ people to the Taliban.

* Mike Causey (running for Commissioner of Insurance) has hiked up our insurance rates 16 times without a public hearing and proudly expanded a loophole that lets insurance companies charge above the legal maximum.

* Chad Brown (running for Sec of State): has made “protecting our elections” a pillar of his campaign, despite the fact that the NC Sec of State office does not administer elections.",1730059167,477,https://www.reddit.com/r/NorthCarolina/comments/1gdjrwm/weird_nc_gop/,99,Sea-Confidence-8540,,,Health,228.3,823.2

NorthCarolina,1gi7m8m,North Carolina can turn blue; we just need to get out and VOTE!,"I've been in NC for almost 13 years now, 26 years old, originally from Utah. I voted for Biden 4 years ago, Clinton back in 2016, and I will vote all blue on Election Day. Mark Robinson is unfit for governor, most if not all of the GOP state House/Senate members are unfit for office, and Trump is definitely unfit for office (especially with the what he's done and said over the past few weeks) 

North Carolina has amazing people, and it's a beautiful state (I've visited Asheboro, Asheville, Outer Banks, Wilmington, Hillsborough and Greensboro this year) - NC deserves better leaders, leaders who care about all of us, and the well being of the state. But only the people decide which way that goes. We must strip the super majority the GOP holds on our legislature and we must elect Stein, who is a million miles better than Robinson, who is a failure and doesn't represent NC very well at all, unlike Stein. Most importantly, Kamala/Walz are the leaders that are going to make this country more successful and prosperous, and not to mention a less divided country. Trump/Vance is not going to do that... especially when that stupid comedian 'jokes' that Puerto Rico is garbage.  I will not vote for people who says: “I don’t blame [Dick Cheney] for sticking with his daughter, but his daughter is a very dumb individual, very dumb. She is a radical war hawk. Let’s put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her, OK? Let’s see how she feels about it. You know, when the guns are trained on her face.” - that's what Trump said to Liz Cheney. We do NOT need that for 4 YEARS!

I'm not a fan of Biden whatsoever, my support towards him continues to drop the more the months pass by. He has in a way damaged the Democratic party and I'm glad he stepped down. 

NC, you are amazing, always my home ❤️

NorthCarolina,1fw0lyp,My employer wanted people to return to the office in WNC by the end of this week.,"What’s going on in Western NC is absolutely devastating and has been hard to watch. I work for a company that has offices all over NC, including ones in WNC. We have a lot of locations in Asheville and Boone. Corporate sent out and email two days ago that said the WNC offices had little damage (how they didn’t have more, I don’t know) and that all were closed because employees evacuated, but that they expected the offices to be reopened and fully staffed by today (October 4th). Based off what I’m seeing online, I don’t believe it’s safe or even possible for a lot of people to drive back. I’m hearing about 30 minute drives taking 3 hours and a body on the side of the road. These trips people are making back are traumatizing. 

I live in ENC, so I’m not one of the ones put in this position. However, this has made me view my company in an entirely different light. They’re all about “treating people right” and I just don’t see how requesting people go back so soon is doing this. Especially since some of these people have probably lost everything. Now they have to go back to work?? What will they go home to? My coworkers told I’m being overdramatic but the news is downplaying how bad it is. The stories I’m seeing from people who are in WNC are a million times worse than what I’m seeing on the news. Are employers in general really asking people to return to work? 

This is crazy, right?

EDIT: I am looking for another job, but I cannot afford to get fired. I used my personal Reddit account and am scared that if I put them on blast, they could track it back to me. They take their online reputation VERY seriously.

EDIT: I’ve seen multiple videos from people on TikTok from WNC nearly in tears talking about bodies. Not a ton, but some. I don’t use Facebook. Again, I am not there.  I am not going to invalidate someone’s experience because if it is true, that would be absolutely horrible. I would like to think that people suffering and actually from the area wouldn’t do that.

NorthCarolina,1g5obnm,"It's our future North Carolina, Ignore MAGA lies and weigh the facts carefully.","# It turns out the report of a truckload of armed militia hunting FEMA workers was untrue; it was only one man, but it clearly shows how unjustified conspiracy rumors can spread and do real damage. And where do most of those conspiracy theories originate? With Trump and his MAGA horde.

Trump, in his insatiable lust for power couldn't care less about the harm he does or the people he hurts -- here is clear proof of that. There is no justification for him and MAGA to disparage the necessary work of FEMA, work to save lives and restore property, as is their mandate from our government.

But Trump works at cross purposes to our government, and with lies, lies, and more lies, sows dissention, hatred, and division, and does everything in his power to separate us from our government so he can swoop in and implement his MAGA Manifesto, Project 2025.

He wanted to implement the Insurrection Act, an Act that would give him complete dictatorial powers, but was thwarted by the Justice Department when he was president. Now Project 2025 will give him the power to dismantle the Justice Department and enable him to acquire complete governmental control.

Think carefully about your country when you cast your ballot.

See this -- boldface mine.

As communities across the Southeast, most notably in **North Carolina,** worked to recover from Hurricane Helene and its aftermath, **Donald Trump spent much of last week brazenly lying** about the governmental response to the deadly storm. State and local officials, including plenty of Republicans, asked him to **stop deceiving the public.** He ignored the appeals. Indeed, the **misinformation and disinformation campaigns are ongoing.** As recently as the weekend, Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo asked the former president whether he believes relief funds were transferred from FEMA to “illegal immigrants.” The Republican insisted that this happened, adding that the evidence to bolster his claims were released by the White House.

**None of this happened in reality.**

Nevertheless, as my MSNBC colleague Clarissa-Jan Lim has explained, officials have said that **Trump’s election season lies and conspiracy theories have hindered relief efforts**, while forcing agencies to **waste time and resources** combatting lies that too many people are falling for. But as it turns out, there’s reason to believe there are **other consequences,** which are every bit as dramatic. The Washington Post reported: Federal emergency response personnel on Saturday had employees operating in hard-hit Rutherford County, N.C., stop working and move to a different area because of concerns over “armed militia” threatening government workers in the region, according to an email sent to federal agencies helping with response in the state. It’s difficult to say just how serious the threat might’ve been, but according to the Post’s report, which has not been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, it was midday Saturday when officials involved in Hurricane Helene recovery efforts received an urgent message.

It reportedly warned that “FEMA has advised all federal responders Rutherford County, NC\*\*, to stand down and evacuate the county immediately.\*\* The message stated that National Guard troops ‘had come across x2 trucks of armed militia saying there were out hunting FEMA.’” The email went on to say that incident management team “have been notified and are coordinating the evacuation of all assigned personnel in that county.” In other words, **Trump and too many of his allies have falsely accused FEMA** and other federal agencies of neglecting places such as Rutherford County, N.C., while in reality, FEMA and other federal agencies are on the ground, providing relief.

At least, they were, until they reportedly had to be “evacuated” for their own safety — not because of unsafe conditions related to the deadly storm, but rather due to concerns that armed extremists might harm them.

Fortunately, the teams returned to work a day later, but that doesn’t make the circumstances any less breathtaking. Indeed, the Post’s report documented several related incidents involving **threats directed at FEMA as a result of outlandish conspiracy theories.** It was against this backdrop that ABC News’ Martha Raddatz asked Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance about Trump’s Helena-related lies.

**“People are worried that their government doesn’t care about them,**” the Ohio senator responded.

Perhaps so, but if people in the area of “worried,” it might have something to do with the fact that his running mate and likeminded conspiracy theories lie on a daily basis about the hurricane and the federal response. It’s twisted reasoning: **Trump and his allies lie, and many believe him. Asked** about the lies, **Vance** points to the concerns of those who put their **faith in a man who deceived them,** as if their fears necessarily have merit, reality be damned.

It’s the precise logic we saw in the wake of the 2020 election, when Republicans pointed to polls showing a significant number of Americans believed conspiracy theories related to the race’s outcome. When Democrats pointed to reality, GOP officials effectively replied, “But look at all of these people who believe otherwise!”

Pointing to the beliefs of those who’ve been lied to does not make the beliefs true.

>“Hello, my name is Craig Carton, with you for another 30 minutes for a frank, open conversation about gambling addiction.”

>Seated alone in the WFAN radio studio in Lower Manhattan where he rose to fame, collapsed in ignominy and later rose again, Mr. Carton began his weekly show the same way he has in the three years since he got out of prison.

>On the line this morning in January was Rob D., a 61-year-old recovering gambling addict who got his start flipping cards in school before he went broke betting on basketball as an adult. Within minutes, Rob was weeping.

>Tears are not unusual in this quiet enclave within the nation’s most famous sports-talk network.

But from 9:30 to 10 every Saturday morning, a new guest enters Mr. Carton’s somber confessional to share his or her tale of addiction.

NorthDakota,1fw84s5,Thinking about visiting Devils Lake to see the flooding,"Hi, Minnesotan here. In a week, I'm taking a trip to Theodore Roosevelt National Park and I'm looking for things to do along the way. One place that caught my attention is Devils Lake due to its history of growing and receding. I've read a few articles about its slow motion flooding and think the idea of renting a kayak and paddling around flooding farms sounds really cool. 

I had a few questions about this:  
1. Should I do this? I realize this could be seen as a little disrespectful. (""""Ooooooh!! Look at the flooded silos! I'm having a fun vacation paddling around someone's former livelihood!"""")  
2. If this is reasonably inoffensive and worth doing, any suggestions for places to stay and/or rent a kayak? I have camping gear and would prefer to camp rather staying in a hotel. 

As a final note, I realize the irony of a Minnesotan going to North Dakota to paddle and not even owning a kayak. You can make fun of me for this if you want lol.

I'm trying to track down possible regions where people pronounce the word 'battery' using 2 syllables (ba-tree) instead of the standard 3 (bat-er-ee).   Like saying the word 'mattress' using a long *'e'* instead of *'ess'*.    ***The car doesn't start.  I think it needs a new battery.***

A friend's mechanic used to pronounce it this way years ago, and at work in the 90s we sometimes used that the pronunciation, tongue-in-cheek, to lighten the day or mood.

Today it came up in conversation that somebody's grandmother in Eastern North Dakota pronounces it this way - with 2 syllables.  I'd always assumed it was just a quirk of speech, but now I'm curious.

""""For the 12th straight week, or three straight months, the national average
has continued to decline, now at its lowest level of 2023 heading into the
prime of the holiday season as oil prices continue to struggle amidst
cooling demand,"""" said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at
GasBuddy. """"With nearly 80,000 gas stations in the U.S. now priced below $3
per gallon, and 23 states also seeing average prices of $2.99 or less,
motorists are getting substantial relief at the pump in time for the
holidays. The trend is likely to continue in most states this week, while
the national average could soon fall below $3.05 per gallon, the lowest
since 2021. The good news may continue into 2024, with GasBuddy's annual
Fuel Outlook being released in just a few weeks.""""

NorthDakota,1fywerw,Horror Movies Set In North Dakota,"With Halloween approaching, I'd share a project I've been working on for a few years, recording the locations of horror movies around the country and the world. 

I am a big fan of horror and am a weird pedantic person who likes to make lists, and while people on r/horror don't seem to be as interested in this, I figured the state subreddits might. Especially if any of you are looking for new movies to watch this month.

 [You can check out my raw data here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17xzKPtu4zeDB4JDQ-Z5E6NfJ0-zL7ZLVeI8LIUZ4sy4/edit?usp=sharing), or check out a more visually pleasing [**Letterbox list I made of North Dakota's horror movies here.**](https://letterboxd.com/horrormoviefan8/list/horror-movies-set-in-north-dakota/)

Now to be clear about my methodology in how I organize these movies. These are organized by where they are *SET* not necessarily by where they are *SHOT*. Example: Most of the Friday the 13th movies are not shot in NJ, but they are all classified as set in NJ because in-universe that is where they take place. In cases where the film's setting is not outright stated, I used context clues such as license plates, driver's licenses, newspapers, references to cities, and so on. While I did take into account where the movie was filmed, I tried not to use that as definitive evidence (there is a reason why the tropes [California Doubling](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaliforniaDoubling) and the [Mountains of Illinois](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMountainsOfIllinois) exist).

[I go into more of the breakdown of movies in this post on ](https://old.reddit.com/r/horror/comments/1ft95ne/horror_movie_atlas_year_6_horror_from_around_the/)r/horror if you are interested.

I have recorded 6 horror movies set in North Dakota, placing the state at #35 in state rankings, tied with Puerto Rico. South Dakota beats you by just 1.

According to IMDB, this makes the North Dakota horror movies from best to worst:

1. [Population 436 (2006)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0462482/)
2. [The Messengers (2007)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425430/?ref_=ttloc_loc_tt)
3. [Devil's Gate (2017)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4610748/?ref_=wl_li_tt)
4. [Leprechaun Returns (2018)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8155182/)
5. [Leprechaun (1993)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107387/)
6. [Killer Movie (2008)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0988083/)

I recommend checking out Devil's Gate and Leprechaun Returns (shockingly the most recent film, a made-for-the-Syfy Channel movie with no Warrick Davis, is the best Leprechaun movie)

I hope you like this, and if you have any more suggestions or corrections you want me to make, please comment. [You can also look at the lists for other states and countries here](https://letterboxd.com/horrormoviefan8/tag/horror/lists/).",1728382789,85,https://www.reddit.com/r/northdakota/comments/1fywerw/horror_movies_set_in_north_dakota/,43,Geek-Haven888,,,Economy and Finance,44,74.3

The Senate of North Dakota proposes increasing the difficulty for the people to pass initiative measures.  From increasing the number of signatures needed to pass by 25 percent (from currently  31,164 to 38,955 ), to narrowing the scope of an initiated measure to one subject as determined by the Secretary of State.

Why does it add 'qualified' to electors? """" If a person is an electors, they are qualified. It may mean something if it is going to narrow the electors able to sign. 


Keep this in mind: This changes only appy to Article III

------
Article IV
Section 16. Any amendment to this constitution may be proposed in either house of the legislative assembly, and if agreed to upon a roll call by a majority of the members elected to each house, must be submitted to the electors and if a majority of the votes cast thereon are in
the affirmative, the amendment is a part of this constitution.

-------
  
So, this part of the constitution is unchanged by this measure. The legislator body would not need two elections to pass a constitutional amendment. 

They could also introduce multi subject measure while we would not be able.",1722230287,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/northdakota/comments/1eerj6k/2024_measure_2_for_general_election/,24,applemashdaily,,,Government Operations and Politics,44,74.3

Ohio,17qt5sl,Next up: End Gerrymandering. Get involved!,"I’m absolutely ecstatic about issues 1 and 2 passing, and I want to encourage Ohioans to build on this grassroots momentum by getting involved in the next step toward building a state government that better reflects the values of the public: ending gerrymandering. 

Ohio is one of the most extremely gerrymandered states in the nation, and since the politicians already in power get to draw the voting maps, that’s not going to change unless the people of Ohio force it to change. 

I’ll be collecting signatures for [Citizens Not Politicians](https://www.citizensnotpoliticians.org/join/), the group that is working on a proposed constitutional amendment that gets politicians and lobbyists OUT of map drawing. Instead, it will be done by a commission of citizens who more accurately reflect the demographic of the state. Click the link above to get involved or donate. This ballot measure would be for November 2024 and could completely reshape Ohio politics! Keep it up, Ohio — I haven’t felt this hopeful for a long time.

EDIT: Some people are asking good questions about how the commission will be chosen and what the process will look like. I think most of those questions can be answered by looking at the summary language on the first three pages [here](https://citizensnotpoliticians.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CNP-Amendment-for-Web.pdf) ",1699470963,1244,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ohio/comments/17qt5sl/next_up_end_gerrymandering_get_involved/,164,TheGreatAbider16,,,Health,478,2366.3

Ohio,17re6jo,Republicans admit they are opposed to democracy.,"Across Ohio and the nation,  the right wing has recently been heard commenting that """"direct democracy is not the way to run a country"""" because Republicans got their asses handed to them on a paper plate. They think that you and I are too stupid to make an informed decision and that """"they"""" should make it for you for your own good. They aren't even trying to hide this. They are stating this publicly that they are opposed to free democracy. Well, authoritarianism by any other name is still Fascism. If you're a Republican you need to take a serious look at your political shit and decide here and NOW what it's going to be: bleak grey Mussellini-esque Fascism with your rights striped away one at a time """"for your own good and because we know better"""" or democracy where you can make choices.
What politicians have publicly come out publicly against direct democracy? In Ohio I do not know, but keep your ear to the ground because they WILL make themselves known. Nationally, Rick Santorum, Brandon Pritchard, Brandon Durst - basically any person or politician in the MAGA category. Do you call yourself MAGA? You are a Fascist by association and by definition a traitor. Got that? You might not like that; it might piss you off, but that does not change the FACT.
If Republican moderates ever grow balls and do something you might have an option.

I'm down with that. He claims Ohioans have a RIGHT to not have to smell offensive but legal odors. Cool. 

Let's also start with Diesel pickup truck, and semi tractor trailers. The exhaust stinks, and I have a RIGHT, as his own mouth said, the RIGHT to not have to be subjected to smelling it. 

Can we have tickets for people with body odor? People that go to a gas station and smell like ass and sweat and dirty feet, should the be arrested or ticketed? I mean, we all have the right to not be subjected to smelling that. Right? 

Will we be banning Mexican food? I personally don't like Mexican food. So, should I be FORCED to smell that from restaurants? It's my right and all, correct? 

School Busses, mass transit busses, highways, parking lots. Matter of fact, what if I don't like the smell of rain? Can we do something about that smell also Mr. Keebler?

All this crap is doing is making """"legal"""" to mandate that while Marijuana is permitted, it's almost impossible to use legally. Blows my mind. They are going to try and regulate and protect peoples rights, from the smell of weed. WOW. 

Glad here in Ohio, there are NO OTHER PROBLEMS, and our elected officials can now take time tackling the tough issues of Ohio. Smells....

Ohio,1es1kgd,What happens when our state stops listening to us altogether?,"**So, in theory, what happens if the Ohio government, like DeWine, Yost, Husted, LaRose, Huffman, etc. just absolutely went against the people of Ohio and entirely stopped listening to voters... like** ***all the way?***

They already showed this behavior with recreational marijuana, where the [Ohio GOP got so brash they were openly bragging and joking](https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/local-news/we-follow-through/ohio-gov-dewine-tries-once-again-to-get-you-marijuana-asap-lawmakers-preventing-it) about how they weren't doing anything about it because they didn't want it to go into effect; DeWine had to step in and tell his party """"Let the will of the people go into effect, the people's house is the people's house.""""

We saw it with the Ohio Department of Education, where Mike DeWine signed legislation that effectively stripped the Ohio State Board of Education of much of its power, transferring significant authority to a new cabinet-level agency under the governor’s control, the Department of Education and Workforce. [This was challenged by the Ohio courts and a temporary restraining order was put on DeWine](https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2023/10/03/governor-begins-ohios-k-12-education-overhaul-despite-judge-extending-temporary-restraining-order/); yet DeWine continued to forward despite being told not to.

Now, [a decision on constitutionality of Ohio's six-week abortion ban](https://www.statenews.org/government-politics/2024-08-13/decision-on-constitutionality-of-ohios-six-week-abortion-ban-to-come-later-this-month) to come later this month. Something we, the people, voted on last year. Topped with [the Ohio GOP's efforts to """"defeat"""" the people's anti-gerrymandering bill](https://www.cleveland.com/news/2024/07/republican-ohio-lawmakers-ponder-proposing-second-redistricting-amendment-to-foil-another-one-they-dont-like.html?outputType=amp), by proposing a counter-bill (much like they did last year), that DeWine is personally advocating for, despite the fact he's part of the reason the issue is on the ballot this November.

Furthermore, [FirstEnergy makes $20 million deal with AG Dave Yost](https://www.cleveland.com/news/2024/08/firstenergy-makes-20-million-deal-with-ag-dave-yost-to-avoid-hb6-prosecution-drop-civil-lawsuit.html) to avoid HB6 prosecution, drop company from civil lawsuit, which also (""""by complete coincidence"""") potentially prevents DeWine (and Husted) from having to testify (which he was called to do) and potentially from investigations as to why DeWine received over $4 million from FirstEnergy, through various means from campaign contributions to donations to his family's initiatives, as well as Husted; who was told to drop and join DeWine's ticket by his biggest donor; FirstEnergy. Not to mention, how they personally worked with FirstEnergy to push HB6.

Ironically, DeWine's involvement with FirstEnergy is similar to a case Mike DeWine, himself, was the prosecutor on back in the day. DeWine prosecuted Amer Ahmad, the former Ohio Deputy Treasurer, for a bribery and money laundering scheme. Ahmad was sentenced to 15 years prison but fled the country before he could be brought in.

Clearly, the Ohio GOP no longer represents Ohio, both the state and the people. Why should we have to respect their """"elected"""" positions, when they don't even respect our elected issues, our elections in general, or the will of the people and their vote? If the Governor, Lt. Governor, Attorney General, and a slew of their comrades are all openly defying the people that gave them their job; and displaying their corruption for all to see... what can we do?

**Yes, of course, we should vote them out; which I hope we do, but what else can we do?** What other checks and balances are in place that could humble the Ohio GOP? To be clear, I don't mean we should riot or start an insurrectionist coup like the January 6th folk. These people should be held accountable in a fair, just, and legal way. I mean, if I don't do my job and just openly defy and ignore bosses and clients; I would get written up or fired, but for the Ohio GOP - that's just another day at the office with not accountability or repercussions. They answer to nobody. We shouldn't have to wait to vote them out for them to face any accountability, to remind them to do their jobs, obey the laws, or to care about the people they serve. *They are supposed to be Ohioans, not oligarchs.*

***So, if your state's governor, lt. governor, attorney general, senate president, senate, house, etc. has fallen into a situation where they refuse to accept the will of the voters, their literal job and how they literately got said job, then what can we do?***

We can't report DeWine to Yost, because he's just as much at fault and owes too much to DeWine and the GOP. Even if we did, did oust DeWine; Husted is just as corrupt apparently. Can't complain to Huffman, because the only thing he's good at is sitting on his hands. LaRose is just a financial liability at this point, expensing the state more than double what he said he would to move his 'official office' into his 'campaign office' or what have you.

Ohio,17uiur8,Contact Mike DeWines office regarding his disrespect of the Peoples will.,"It only takes a couple minutes. [Here is the website to contact him.](https://governor.ohio.gov/contact)

Copy/paste the following message, courtesy of ChatGPT or create your own from scratch. 

I am writing to express my deep concern and disappointment regarding recent attempts to scale back the new recreational marijuana bill that was democratically passed by the voters. As a resident of this great state, I believe it is essential to uphold the democratic process and respect the expressed will of the people.

The passage of the recreational marijuana bill was a significant moment, signifying the collective voice and choice of Ohio's citizens. It is disheartening to witness efforts to diminish the impact of this legislation, as it appears to contradict the democratic principles we hold dear.

I understand that policy decisions involve complex considerations, and adjustments may be deemed necessary for various reasons. However, it is crucial that any modifications made to the legislation align with the intentions of the voters and are carried out transparently.

The democratic process thrives on the participation and trust of the electorate. When citizens exercise their right to vote, they do so with the expectation that their choices will be respected. Attempts to scale back the recreational marijuana bill raise concerns about the integrity of our democratic system and the faith citizens place in their elected officials.

I respectfully urge you to reconsider any actions that may undermine the will of the voters and to ensure that the implementation of the recreational marijuana bill aligns with the spirit and intent of the legislation as passed. Transparency in the decision-making process will foster a greater understanding among the public and contribute to the overall trust in our democratic institutions.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I trust that you will give careful consideration to the sentiments of the citizens you serve.",1699904389,989,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ohio/comments/17uiur8/contact_mike_dewines_office_regarding_his/,84,jbrown5390,,,Health,478,2366.3

Oklahoma,1etxbyj,Update: Scamraiser canceled,"I know everyone is probably sick of hearing about this turd but I wanted to update everyone here about the backlash. 

Once the restaurant started getting an influx of bad reviews, they sent their prayer warriors to counteract the bad reviews. The whole town started flipping out about cancel culture and that dude probably has his biggest $$$ day since opening yesterday due to everyone flocking there to support him. 

I for one don’t buy it. Part of the reason people are upset is because he previously reportedly turned down a dem meeting & drag brunch because he “didn’t want to get political.” 

Now the entire town has made a huge fuss about it and they’ve even started a gofundme 🙄 for the restaurant. 

First of all— it was for an hour? How much $ could he have possibly lost from this getting canceled? And like I said, the place was supposedly packed yesterday with supporters. 

I don’t believe for a second that this was a “mistake” and he was unaware of Walters’ politics (he hasn’t claimed it was) and to me, there’s no excuse as a business owner in the year 2024. Everything is political whether you like it or not.

Oklahoma,18ct9y4,I'm scared of all these dangerous animals 😅,"Hey, I'm visiting a friend in Oklahoma in January and it's my first time traveling outside of Europe ( which has very few extremely dangerous animals at least where I've been) and living in England my whole life there is like nothing. Even mosquitos don't carry diseases really and I guess the most dangerous animal might be dogs or something it's that safe here.

That being said I've been googling and preparing myself by looking at the most dangerous animals in Oklahoma and as someone who has arachnophobia I am obviously freaking out about the black widow and brown recluse spiders (in fact I can't even look at the pictures of them and apparently they like being in beds and can bite if you roll over 😅)
And then I see Ticks and Rattlesnakes, kissing bugs, dangerous centipedes and apparently the mosquitoes there can actually carry diseases so someone set my mind at ease lol. I've never been somewhere with spiders and tiny bugs like ticks that can make you very ill so Its a little scary!

I also just read that getting stung by a Tarantula Hawk is one of the most painful things ever a human can experience so in conclusion it all sounds bad and a little scary I don't want to encounter any of these things 😄
Are any of these less common in January perhaps?

Oregon,1dukn64,ODF has declared the start of wildfire season. Keep the fireworks out the the state forest.,"SALEM, Ore. – As of today, July 3, all Oregon Department of Forestry (ODF) districts are in fire season. This means that to reduce the risk of human-caused wildfires, fire restrictions may be in place where you live or at a destination you plan to visit or recreate. 

ODF protects over 16 million acres of private, county, state, and federal land in Oregon from wildfire. Fire season is declared at the local level when conditions reach a point where the risk of a fire starting and spreading becomes clear. This year, the Southwest Oregon district was the first to declare on June 1, and the North Cascade District was the last to declare on July 3. 

As we move into the Fourth of July and the holiday weekend, it’s important to remember that forests and fireworks DO NOT MIX. Fireworks are banned in all State Forest designated recreation sites including campgrounds, camping areas, day-use areas, trailheads, staging areas, and boat launch sites. Remember to check any additional city and county firework restrictions as well.  

“Mid-July and August are known for high fire occurrence due to increased lightning activity, but human activities continue to be the leading source of Oregon’s wildfires. RIGHT NOW is the time to practice fire safety and preparedness.  Wildfire is already on the landscape,” said Chris Cline, Oregon Department of Forestry’s Protection Division Chief. 

Cline said, “Prevention is our number one tool to reduce property loss and firefighting costs. We can’t prevent lightning fires, but we can prevent human-caused fires…and we need everyone’s help to that end!”

With a heat wave expected from July 4th into next week, now is the time to brush up on your wildfire prevention knowledge. Tips include:

Know before you go. Campfires may be banned or only allowed in approved campgrounds.
Make sure your campfire is cool to the touch before going to sleep or leaving your site. Don’t forget to Drown, Stir, Repeat. 
Backyard debris burning either requires a burn permit during fire season or is prohibited altogether. If you burned earlier this spring, go back and check on your debris burn site to make sure nothing reignites due to the heat.
Don’t flick a cigarette onto the ground. It may be just enough to start a fire.
Don’t park or idle over dried grass.
Don’t drag tow chains.
Check local restrictions and fire danger levels.

Oregon,1bzz44t,Is tipping culture getting out of hand?,"I went out to get a slice of pizza the other day at a place where you order at the counter and they hand you your pizza. You bus your own table and nobody comes to check on you. When ordering, the card reader machine asked if I’d like to leave a tip. The lowest standard option was 18%. Is this the standard for Oregon now?

Look I can kind of understand how American tipping culture got started. It was a way to reward good service and it allowed restaurant owners to avoid paying employees wages. But in Oregon service workers at least make minimum wage, and with most places asking you to tip before you’ve even gotten your food, it’s starting to feel more like a tax. It’s also frustrating how the new card reader machines shift our perceptions of what a good tip is. My understanding was that 15% at a sit down restaurant was standard for good service and that sometimes leaving only 10% was fine. Now the spreads are 18% 20% and 25% for a cup of coffee, like they’re daring me to key in 15% or something and hold up the line.

Oregon,1dpgqhl,Remove those license plate covers!,"The Oregon Court of Appeals just affirmed license plate covers which interfere with legibility of your plate is sufficient probable cause for law enforcement to pull you over. Here is the media summary for the case:

State of Oregon v. Dylan Lee Mendell

(Aoyagi, Presiding Judge)

Defendant appeals his conviction for driving under the influence of intoxicants, assigning error to the denial of his motion to suppress. Defendant was stopped while driving at night, because his license plate had a clear plastic cover over it that reflected headlights in a way that made it unreadable. The sheriff's deputy who made the stop believed that he had probable cause that defendant had violated ORS 803.550, which prohibits knowingly displaying an """"altered, modified, covered or obscured"""" license plate. During the stop, the deputy discovered evidence that defendant was under the influence of intoxicants. Defendant later moved to suppress that evidence, arguing that the deputy lacked probable cause for the initial traffic stop. The trial court denied the motion, reasoning that """"\[t\]he plastic covering affixed to the license plate constituted an alteration of the license plate, and obscured the license plate, as those terms are used in ORS 803.550(2)."""" Held: The trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress. The deputy had probable cause to stop defendant for a violation of ORS 803.550, where defendant's license plate was covered with plastic material in a way that rendered it unreadable in normal nighttime driving conditions. Affirmed.

Edit: Decision was by the Court of Appeals not the State Supreme Court. Sorry for the mistake.",1719456111,420,https://www.reddit.com/r/oregon/comments/1dpgqhl/remove_those_license_plate_covers/,203,oldsweng1,,,Crime and Law Enforcement,180.3,733.3

Oregon,1bdalyf,Oregon unemployment is the worst ever,"Hey all. 
I live in Portland Oregon, and for the first time in my life I had to file for unemployment.
Provided all my information, got one payment. They then denied a few weeks of payment, as I “needed to validate my address”. (I had already done this with their antiquated system, and gotten one check).
Validated my address in person at “work source” location. Got 3 more checks, then my claims were denied.
I was told I had indicated that i was returning to work (not the case).
The only way to “resolve” the issue was to call in. The state had been updating their antiquated system, so no support was available for a week.
Call stats: 
Times called to get past a busy signal: 226
Hours on hold: 15
Dropped calls: 5

Still on hold.

The last Oregon unemployment system is the most dysfunctional system I’ve ever seen.

If you live in a Oregon, expect the most whacked system ever with no way to contact anyone 

I got 4 out of 14 claims I’ve submitted. No reason why I should have been denied. 
 
Lovely. They just disconnected the call after being on hold for 5 hours today

Oregon,1e8w27t,The number of homes for sale on the coast is insane. Why are prices still so high? Who is buying these places?,"I totally get it when some mansion sells for millions of dollars right next to the ocean. It's a rich person buying some 4th property so they can spend 1 week a year there.

But a lot of these +500k homes are nothing special. They're in areas without much industry and certainly not the kinds of jobs that pay enough to afford a mortgage at normal interest rates on a property like that. I'm not talking Seaside or Cannon, either.

Looking at Zillow shows there are an incredible number of places for sale all down the coast. The number of places for sale goes up as you descend the coast, but the price stays high.

Who is buying these houses at these insane prices?

**Edit**: wow, lots of great responses. Thanks! Just to clear up one thing -- I'm not an out-of-stater looking to move to the Oregon Coast. Not going to dox myself, so I'll just leave it at that.

Sounds like a lot of these places are left to sit on the market for extended periods and only typically sell to out of state people who are either retiring or working remotely (typically from Seattle or Cali)... or AirBnB. A lot of the places are poorly built or need a lot of work (which is shockingly obvious from many of the photos on the listings). Unwillingness to reduce prices seems to come from the lack of need to reduce price because most of these homes are second, third, etc investment properties that people don't *need* to sell immediately.

Pretty shitty all around. IMO, third and beyond properties should be taxed at some obscene rate to eliminate this kind of crap.",1721594477,409,https://www.reddit.com/r/oregon/comments/1e8w27t/the_number_of_homes_for_sale_on_the_coast_is/,297,ThaFiggyPudding,,,Economy and Finance,180.3,733.3

",". Sen. John Fetterman was speeding when he crashed into the back of another vehicle Sunday in Maryland, according to a police report obtained by TribLive.

Fetterman, a Democrat from Braddock, was westbound on Interstate 70 at 7:45 a.m. Sunday when he rear-ended a vehicle near the interchange with Interstate 68 near Hancock, Md., according to Maryland State Police

Fetterman, who was traveling with his wife, drove “at a high rate of speed, well over the posted speed limit” before rear-ending the Impala. The speed limit was 70 mph. The report said Fetterman was “at fault.” The front air bags in Fetterman’s Traverse deployed during the crash.

The cars were towed from the accident site. Fetterman, his wife, Gisele, and the driver of the other car were taken to War Memorial Hospital in West Virginia in ambulances.

Pennsylvania,1fuh97n,A Story about Rural Pennsylvania (Washington County),"I believe this happened in late 2020, when I was living in rural Washington County.  We have a pretty big plot of land and we’re selective of who we let onto it.  This guy Ed had been coming out for years.  He’d put out traps for the coyotes and he like walking in the woods.  I liked to catch him when he came by because he was a nice guy.  He’s older, probably in his 50s and white. 

I’d be out playing in the yard with my 2 YO and Ed would come back from the fields on his ATV.  He’d show my kid anything he got that day.  During trapping season, he’s out every day, so especially in 2020 when we didn’t see anyone, it was nice to chat with Ed.

One day we’re chatting and he says, “I see you’ve got a Warren sticker on your car?”  Internally my whole soul shrivels up.  No, Ed, don’t do this to me.  Don’t make me dislike you.  Let’s just leave politics out of this nice relationship.  “Yeah…” I say cautiously.  Well, Ed goes right off.  “Oh man, I wish she’d won the primary!  I liked her!” Then he goes on a long rant about how his wife is disabled and Trump politicized covid precautions, how he believes in science etc etc.

Pennsylvania,1ghz4qg,Actual facts about PA early voting… don’t fall for misinfo,"Reiterating once again for the RW clickbait Twitter accounts trying to claim fraud again.

There is no in-person early voting in PA. It is only in-demand mail-in voting. Why are people reporting 3+ hour long wait times at polling places? Because they didn’t request a mail-in ballot ahead of time! This is entirely on you. If you want to vote early in PA, you show up, request a mail-in ballot, application is processed, you wait, and they give you a mail-in ballot to fill out.  There is no conspiracy here. There is no cheating going on. There are long wait times because, after Republican voters were told that mail-in voting was cheating in 2020, it is now magically secure since DJT says so.  These people don’t understand how the process works, so they assume foul play is occurring. Bottom line: if you didn’t request a ballot ahead of time, urge your Republican lawmakers to allow PA early voting like other states, or don’t complain when you have to wait in line.

“Everything is a conspiracy when you don’t know how anything works”

EDIT: thanks everyone for sharing this, just trying to help out PA voters navigate this complicated process. For a more detailed description, I posted more info here: https://www.reddit.com/r/BucksCountyPA/s/JS6cyH472I

Also he said they had to do diving contest in which 3 dives were judged by the teacher. This whole scenario blows my mind. 

He said he never mentioned it to his folks because he figured it just was the way things were and they respected their teachers. But straight up naked diving?? 

Anyways Hugely embarrassing, I could tell he was still scarred from the whole experience, and was not just b*********** .. so since I have NEVER heard of this happening in a public school setting I wonder is there a whole bunch of dudes in their early 70s just burying this memory or did my client just go to the most f-d up PE swim class ever?

RhodeIsland,1bkjxu8,Scam alert,"Today I received a call from someone claiming to be a RI constable from Newport County in order to serve me papers because """"im being sued"""". They had some of my personal info. Their story didnt check out and they were quite aggressive with me, so I hung up on them. They called back and threatened to have me thrown in jail. I asked about the case and the court it was filed in, they refused to give me the info. I was 99% that it was a scam call, so I called an actual constable to ask if theyve heard of this sort of scam before. They hadnt, but assured me that it was extremely fishy and not to give that person any info about them. Be careful out there. If you get a call like this, ask the server for their name, employer name, badge number, case number. If they cant answer those questions and have them verified, dont give them any info. If they get angry or aggressive, dont give them any info. In fact, just err on the side of dont give them any info. Make them do their jobs and find you. This wasnt your usual """"car warranty"""" or """"IRS"""" scam where the person had a clearly foreign accent. This sounded like the guy was from an advertising agency or like Ohio or something.

RhodeIsland,1dq5x6s,Join me and many others on the fight against the DMV's Kei truck ban.,"Hi, my name is Ian. I've been a lifelong resident of Rhode Island, and I really enjoy odd and unusual cars. As some of you may know, back in 2021, the   DMV decided to follow the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA) best practice suggestions when it comes to Japanese """"Kei"""" vehicles. Kei, or keijidosha, is a classification of vehicles in Japan that are restricted on their size, weight, and engine capacity. This recommendation by the AAMVA was to prevent these vehicles from being registered in the state, while also revoking existing registrations currently on the road. The reason behind this is that they claim to have """"never been manufactured to meet US safely standards.""""

Under US Federal law, once a vehicle becomes 25 years old, it is completely exempt from NHTSA safety standards, as well as EPA Emissions standards. 

Recently, the state as decided to allow LSVs, or """"Low-Speed Vehicles"""" to be registered for roads with posted speed limits of 25 or below. These LSVs are essentially glorified golf cars, equipped with turn signals and head/tail lights. They are limited to electric power only. They are typically smaller, lighter, and most likely just as unsafe as your typical kei vehicle. This causes a problem when the DMV argues against Kei vehicles. How can you claim one larger automobile to be """"unsafe"""" when you're allowing even smaller, slower vehicles on public roadways? 

Aside from the LSV legislation, the state is also currently trying to allow previous registered kei vehicles to have their registrations renewed under a """"grandfather"""" clause. This doesn't exactly make sense as you're still preventing new registrations, but saying it's okay for existing keis to be good? 

If you've ever seen one of these little trucks on the road and thought """"hey, that'd be awesome to have for around town!"""" then please join me in my battle against the DMV. Texas just managed to regain the ability to register these, but it took lots of support and effort from the community. I started a new Facebook group to be able to stay organized and able to efficiently update everybody on our progress. I would appreciate it if you would join. 

Thank you for reading, it truly does mean a lot.",1719532561,176,https://www.facebook.com/share/np8LX3QZrk27hcQT/?mibextid=A7sQZp,59,ELITExKILLER,,,Health,82,218

A local developer has earned approval from the city to build a nearly 60-unit apartment building that could help address the ongoing housing affordability crisis. But the approval came with one stipulation: The units are banned from ever becoming short-term rentals, such as Airbnbs.

Now one of the city’s top planning chiefs says that little-before-used caveat may become the new standard to limiting short-term rentals in some parts of the city. The intention, he said, is to promote development that will include housing — and without the unintended consequences of constructing new Airbnbs.

RhodeIsland,1fcttuf,Weirdly Approached at Target in Warwick,"This happened yesterday around 3pm in the target on bald hill road in Warwick. I keep thinking about it and the interaction isn’t sitting right with me and I feel like I’ve seen other people post before that they’ve had questionable interactions at this target location, so I wanted to share. 

I (27F) was by myself shopping, literally in the women’s tampon/ pad aisle of all places, when this man comes around the corner. He was about 5’8, African American, bald, maybe in his late 20s early 30s. He starts the conversation by asking “excuse me do you speak English?” I say yes. He then takes a dollar and some change from his pocket and holds it in his hand in front of me and starts on this rant “could you do me a favor, I really need to buy milk for my kids, could you come to the front register with me?” He was speaking quickly and I was trying to process what exactly he was asking of me. Because my assumption is oh, is he asking me for money? But then why is he also asking me to go to the front of the store with him? His story didn’t really make sense. As a human being of course I have an urge to help, but my body was hot/ I felt uncomfortable so I just said to him “I’m sorry I can’t help you.” He didn’t take that for an answer, he tried asking me to go with him a SECOND time. I repeated “I can’t help you.” And then he walked away… 

I thought it was really odd. Say this person really is in need of money, why aren’t you panhandling outside the store? Why would I have to go with him to buy the milk? The milk isn’t even in the front of the store, it’s in the back! And I was in the women’s products aisle of all places to be approached, and I was alone. I really wonder what his intentions are and just wanted to put this out there in case any other woman or person is approached in this way!

SouthCarolina,1f78jb3,SC Workers Deserve Better - Labor Day statement from the SC AFL-CIO,"This Labor Day, we are celebrating all workers in South Carolina, in every sector of the economy. Thisincludes grad students, auto workers, flight attendants, pilots, teachers, ironworkers, designers, journalists,mechanics, engineers, baristas and more! These South Carolinians from all walks of life clock in everyday to power our local economy and they should all be celebrated with dignity on the job, fair wages, andgood benefits. However, we know that so many in our community still struggle to make ends meet.
Despite the fact that we are working harder than ever, for longer hours, it’s only been getting more
difficult to make our paychecks stretch until the end of the month. Meanwhile, the companies we work forare reporting record profits year after year and CEOs are getting massive paydays.

For decades, South Carolinians have been told that our state is anti-union, and our leaders market the stateas such. But this isn’t true. A poll conducted by the Union of Southern Service Workers this year showedthat two-thirds of likely voters in South Carolina are in favor of unions, the same as the national average.Working South Carolinians are not anti-union. It’s Governor McMaster who’s anti-union. And it’s the companies moving here so they can pay poverty wages and take advantage of corporate handouts that areanti-union.

Things don't have to be this way. Unions are the single best tool working people have to stand up toinequity and corporate greed. Every day, more workers are seeing past the lies and the well-fundedanti-union campaigns from corporate America and deciding to come together to demand the respect andfair treatment we deserve.

Standing in solidarity with co-workers in a union makes a real difference in our lives that uplifts ourfamilies for generations. Workers in labor unions make 18% more in wages than our nonunioncounterparts. We are more likely to have health care benefits that allow our children to get the medicalcare they need without going bankrupt. We work in safer workplaces where we can speak up abouthazards without the fear of losing our income. We have more job security—even and especially inmoments of economic crisis. Countries where most workers are in a union are among the happiest andhealthiest on Earth. Life is better in a union.

Gov. McMaster said earlier this year that he would fight organized labor “to the gates of hell.” If that is afight he wants, he’s welcome to it. But it’s not us marching in that direction. While he is standingalongside those fiery gates, organized labor, our allies, and working people across this state will befighting to make our lives better. We will be organizing around the clock to make sure that workingpeople get their fair share here and now. We do the work. We keep this state moving forward. We buildthe future. And that future is one where working people are treated with dignity and respect.",1725288376,270,https://i.redd.it/a4umeyq4semd1.jpeg,66,CharlestonAlliance,https://storage.googleapis.com/policy_posse_reddit_images/reddit_post_images/1f78jb3.jpg,https://storage.googleapis.com/policy_posse_reddit_images/reddit_post_images/1f78jb3.jpg,Health,161,268.6

Once I was selling Kirby vacuums door to door. My team pulled up in some neighborhood in Lyman and a couple of us went to this one house. We start giving our presentation and the owner is walking us through the house and I see people riding four wheelers in the backyard. I immediately recognized one as DMX but didn’t say anything. He eventually walked in and was like “fuck is goin on”. The owner, we later found out was a friend of his family, explained and X was like “PARDON ME, I’M FUCKIN UP THE FLOOR YALL TRYNA CLEAN”. He then proceeded to sit and watch us clean the whole living room with the Kirby. He was like “that’s an amazing piece of machinery and y’all did a great job, I wouldn’t buy it though”, and went back to the four wheelers in the backyard. The owner didn’t buy either, bitch. Lol

Please listen up!! 
My career is in Emergency Medicine and I had ZERO knowledge of this!!

I have been researching an upcoming pelvic floor surgery procedure, and have found something EXTREMELY DISTURBING, I WAS COMPLETELY UNAWARE OF! Especially with my years in Healthcare!

Most states in America actually allow.. 
""""MEDICAL STUDENTS OR OTHERWISE UNAUTHORIZED PERSONNEL TO PERFORM PELVIC AND OR RECTAL EXAMS TO UNKNOWING patients while under Anesthesia
DURING OPERATIONS!!""""
AND YES, ATRIUM IN CHARLOTTE IS A TEACHING HOSPITAL THAT PROMOTES THIS!!

I was appalled!
and suddenly began to look for South Carolina laws.. WE ARE ONE OF THE STATES THAT ALLOW THIS SEXUAL ASSAULT TO HAPPEN AND ALWAYS HAVE!
Trying to research your state is very confusing! The National Medical board of course has never published an actual list of specific states that do/do not allow this.. 
You have to sift through your own States legislative jargon and page after page of bull$hit to TRY to get a definitive answer!
Some states are clear and easy to spot due to youtube news clips n such..
PLEASE RESEARCH YOUR STATE RIGHT NOW!
Do NOT ALLOW this to happen to you too!
I meet with my surgeon tomorrow.. This is Topic #1 on my list!
No consent to ANY OF THESE ATROCITIES!

SouthCarolina,1g6tmlo,PSA: Voting,"With early voting starting on Monday, this is your reminder to research who and what will be on the ballot before you go vote. For example, my district is voting on 16 different offices, two county tax proposals, and the state constitutional amendment. There are many districts within the state that will have over 20 elected positions needed to be filled.

Also, you ** DO NOT** have to make a selection for every race. I implore you to not simply hit the """"vote by party"""" option on the first screen and then cast your vote. There are some extremes being offered this year. If you look into the candidates running for an office and dislike your options, it is perfectly okay to leave that section blank. I know it is often treated like politics are sports and you *must* support your team's candidate, but you are not obligated to vote for someone just because they have the correct letter after their name on the ballot. If you don't like the candidate your party put forward, and you can't bring yourself to vote for their opponent, then move on to the next category. 

I bring this up because percentages really matter to the staffers who ultimately run the office behind the scenes and will make different choices on what to present to the elected officials as important. Even if your party does a clean sweep and wins every office in your district, the staffers will take note of *Candidates A and B won with 75% but Candidate C only won with 60%. Why did they have less support among the same group of voters?* It really helps keep some nuance in our political system and hopefully would slow down our race to opposite extremes.

SouthCarolina,1b78e46,Duke Energy is cheating solar panel owners of deserved credit for energy returned.,"**UPDATE: This has been resolved. With the help of Nate Morabito, Investigative Reporter from WCNC, Duke Energy finally researched the issue and corrected the error for myself and """"several"""" other accounts.**

Duke Energy is not calculating solar owners' bills correctly. They instituted a """"$30 minimum bill"""" in South Carolina, but they are not actually calculating it correctly according to their own rate document.

They are adding the Monthly Minimum Charge after including the Credit for Net Excess Energy, effectively negating that credit completely with additional charges. Their own rate document says the minimum bill applies to charges only and credit would reduce the bill.

I know for a fact that this is done incorrectly in South Carolina, but I believe it is done incorrectly anywhere Duke Energy has instituted a """"minimum bill"""".

The parent who brought the challenge has now elevated it to the state board because they do not accept that. So yes, there is a parent somewhere in the state who wants to Kill a Mockingbird removed from schools so badly that they have gone through multiple hearings about it and keep pressing it.

SouthCarolina,1cjr4q5,"Myrtle Beach Pastor Announces Wife's Death After Sermon, says suicide, but locals are finding evidence that suggest otherwise.","3:00 pm est 5/4/24 update: someone was arrested from the church today. No word on a name…yet. 


Even though this case is new, there is SO much information coming out. I will try my best to keep things on topic and not confusing. I urge you to read until the end. It's going to end up being a huge case, there are a couple deaths involved, but we are here mostly and most recently for Mica Miller.

Victim: Mica Miller  
Husband: John Paul (JP) Miller  
Father of JP: Wayne Miller

When Mica was 14 years old, she lived in Myrtle Beach, SC and started attending youth group at Solid Rock Church. It was there that 28 year old year old JP started grooming her while he was married to his wife, who he shares 5 children with. His charges when he was married to her:

1. Knowingly damage property (2x)
2. Aggravated assault/deadly weapon
3. Possession of a liquor by minor (2x)
4. Possession of consumed liquor by a minor
5. Possession cannibis <2.5 grams (same night as the minors)
6. Contributing to the delinquency of a child
7. Domestic battery/bodily harm
8. Domestic battery/physical contact
9. Assault/assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature (2x)
10. Being on premises after warning or refuse to leave

The two got married when Mica was 23, and JP was 37. JP is the owner of the church Solid Rock, and from local reviews, ran off a lot of people. He had misogynistic views, would verbally attack people, and everyone feared for Mica. He verbally, financially, mentally, physically, spiritually, and sexually assaulted her throughout their marriage. If she wanted to leave, he would have her committed to the mental hospital. He openly talked about her struggles during his sermons, as did she. JP failed to mention HE was the reason for her mental struggles. He would emotionally torture her, make her watch him have sex with other women in front of her, slash her tires, stalk her, put tracking devices on her car, she was even sleeping couch to couch terrified of him finding and committing her again. From another friend, Mica escaped JP in February 2024. Friends were hiding Mica. She found out he was doing things with the money from the church and after that he put her in a mental hospital, again. When she got out, she told her friend, """"I am not mentally ill, I'm not sick, I don't want to harm myself, and he is going to make it look like I killed myself. He's going to try to frame me. One day I know he's going to do it."""" The church is not listed with the Southern Baptist Convention, nor it is listed as a non-profit. This could have been what Mica found out, he was committing tax fraud and had been for years. This last month, she started reconnecting with friends that JP had forced her to isolate from. One message from Mica to a friend on April 5 reads, :Thank.you for your gentle warnings throughout the years regarding my relationship with JP. I know that you knew I wasn't ready to get out but looking back your warnings were very helpful when trying to make tough life decisions. Definitely have replayed our convo's in my head over and over throughout the years and wished there was something I could do to get out. And now I've done it :)""""

To give you an example of what this guy is like when he preaches, In February 2024, here's part of a sermon he read aloud to his churchgoers: You know, a year ago, my wife, they went to Africa they had a wonderful trip and she came back with the idea to start a school in Africa. And 6 weeks ago she """"**goes to the hospital""""**, gets out, and just leaves me, completely leaves me, drains our bank accounts, and I go, """"Guess what? While you're talking bad about me out there I'm building a school in Africa for over 100 kids in order for them to be fed!"""" ...Goes on about God. then """"One day I'm gonna preach to God about getting rich, strong, healthy, and finding a hot wife that loves Jesus! That's what I'm gonna do."""" Then, he continues to bash Mica saying """"When my wife was in the hospital, um you know I looked at her phone, and I counted over the past 2 years, 18 people who had text her and said """"If you ever want to talk to someone about your husband, you can talk to me and say anything and I'll keep it confidential."""" This made him VISIBLY angry while on stage.

Mica filed for divorce and a protective order 48 hours before she was found dead.

The crime: In her final week she made plans to get her hair cut, get help with her car payment because she was a little short after paying the divorce lawyer, and planned on meeting her friends at a church service Sunday, April 28. On Saturday, April 27, Mica left in her work uniform to work at JPeters, a local restaurant. She never showed. Her body was discovered an hour and a half away, in Lumberton, NC. Her cause of death is a gun shot wound to the head. JP was not allowing her family to see her and was pushing for a quick cremation (that was denied and the family has seen her).  
Hours later, her husband, holds church service as normal Sunday, April 29. He has no remorse, emotion, and cracks jokes during his sermon. In the last 30 seconds of it, he says (and I'm paraphrasing but listening to it as I go) """"I have an announcement and I ask that after it you leave the church and do not talk about my announcement. I hope you continue to come to church and serve and give, you know, for the next little bit, I'm taking a little bit of a break, and I don't want to have to worry about the church. My break might be a few days, or a few weeks, I don't know. Uh I got a call late last night my wife has passed away and yeah it was self induced and it was up in North Carolina. And um we'll have a funeral for her next Sunday here at 3:00, and um yeah that's- I'm just, you know, going on adrenaline right now. Yall know she wasn't well mentally and uh she needed her medicine that was hard to get."""" (There is a video of this, despite JP deleting it from their church YouTube).  
3 days later her husband is seen and photographed at Coastal Grand Mall going into a sushi restaurant with his supposed girlfriend, Suzi. He is looking right into the camera.  
4 days later he is seen and photographed in a restaurant called Kingstreet Grille with the same supposed girlfriend, Suzi. She is looking at the camera with her eyebrows raised and her hand over her mouth.

On May 1, JP informed a news outlet he could not do their scheduled interview as he was leaving town for a few days. Today, May 3, the church has permanently closed.

SUZI SKINNER'S HUSBAND'S MYSTERIOUS DEATH (Girl from recent photos): it was common knowledge that JP and Suzi had been dating for a years. They h ave been sharing food and blankets at soccer games and they've been seen at the water park. in 2021, Suzi's then husband, who was paralyzed and lived his life in a wheelchair, drowned in a pool and it was """"accident"""". Yes, you read that right.

WAYNE MILLER (AND ANOTHER MYSTERIOUS DEATH): (Living in Myrtle Beach as well) Arrested for hooking up with a minor in a shower, molestation charges, and then had the charges expunged. This was in the 90's.  
He forced J1 visa students who paid to trail to the US to attend his """"bible college"""", failure to pay them even minimum wage, failure to provide them with adequate shelter, food and more. He had federal charges from ICE for abusing the immigrant students while with him.  
He was exposed for lewd acts in Pakistan a few years back. He was living in a private society at the time called Eden Garden, which was full of younger boys. Remember, he has a history of molestation. Jerry Savelle, who started a church in Pakistan that Wayne was associated with, passed away on April 14, 2024 with no clear cause of death. In a video, you can see them talk about how Dr. Jerry Seville didn't know all the illegal things Wayne was doing and didn't realize he (Savelle) was contributing to.  
Also in Pakistan, he had a plan to make a false accusation in the Pakistan Court system because he was about to get exposed for his homosexual relationship and all the sexual abuse he was committing there. The allegations (we don't know what they were) were proven to be false by Pakistan Court this past October. He then had his male lover come to America with his Pakistan sister, and Troy (Wayne's friend) was the """"sponsor"""" to marry the sister so they could come here. An article about Troy from 2003 reads, """"A former Myrtle Beach area pastor is facing charges of child molestation. 32-year old Robert Troy Taylor turned himself in to Georgetown County Authorities Saturday. He's the former pastor at the Low Country Community Church in Murrell's Inlet, just south of Myrtle Beach. The charges are reportedly connected to two incidents with 12- year old boys from more than a decade ago."""" The company you keep.....

JP's OLDER SON: He has a history of domestic abuse against his wife and served time for hitting her over the head with a glass bottle in January 2024.

Search the hashtag JusticeForMica on Facebook and you can see videos, pictures, text messages, etc. Please ignore the obituary this abuser wrote, it is so disgusting. Paints himself in an amazing light. This is only the beginning. Her death was called a suicide, but Robeson County is investigating it and ALL of this information has been sent to our local police department as well as Robeson County. A protest is being held on the public property outside of the church and walk around a few blocks on Sunday at 9:00 am, even though the news came out today they are closed. This is for Mica. One of her last videos she uploaded to her Facebook was her speaking out about her abuse, and she looks so empty inside.

Sorry if this was confusing, but police have barely released any information except the basics. But the rest were from old articles and people's stories about her. I tried to piece it all together the best I could to show this entire family is about to go down, as they should have a long time ago.

SouthCarolina,1g4exck,Gullah Geechee on the Rise!,"(Pics — Great-grandmother & Grandma)

Many Black Americans today are exploring their heritage, tracing it back to the Geechee community in South Carolina. My own story is similar! My maternal great-grandmother was born in Tillman, SC (often listed as Ridgeland) to a freedwoman and a mulatto freedman of Irish descent. (Don’t worry; it’s not as complicated as it might sound!)

That freedwoman was a Geechee woman, but she didn't pass down her culture to my great-grandmother or the rest of the family, so I’m eager to reclaim what was lost.

If anyone has recommendations on essential sites or resources related to Geechee culture, I’d love to hear them. Some of my family has never left the South, and I’m planning a trip to do some research.

Trump is mentioned 312 times in Project 2025.

in two instances, """"trump"""" does not refer to the former president: Once it was used as a verb (""""to trump"""") and in another instance as an adjective (""""trumped-up""""). Additionally, 158 mentions refer to the Trump administration rather than to Trump himself.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-true-though-slightly-185500609.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAGz5glETMCYFMTQAX6wQcWYj5CmQjhwcuRTxCrcn3q5jox7tKPPLzTDNZ5sSv5n8nacCjD7QeV_lNWEMIud3H9JvI4D6sUmxYQ1rsUjooa7PP1Jq9eOH7gVWTQJp1QWmf9B3fAXGZWL5QFV5PWaGJtqExVAIPfI27GXsHPcIm-ZF

There are 31 people from Trump's administration that are part of it Project 2025.

Trump is deeply connected to key authors of Project 2025, which include Paul Dans, Roger Severino, Ken Cuccinelli, Christopher Miller, and Russ Vought.

All of these people served in Trump's administration and are considered serious contenders for top positions in any second Trump term if he were to win office. Also, Russ Vought and Ed Martin, who helped craft Project 2025, are authors also of the new Republican Party platform.

So they're deeply connected to the party apparatus, and as well as Stephen Miller. He is someone who was a top adviser to President Trump when he was in the White House and still remains a top adviser to Trump.

Three of the judges he got in SCOTUS were pt in by the Heritage Foundation, the architects of Project 2025. 

Project 2025 proposes placing the Justice Department squarely under Donald Trump's authority, doing away with any traditional independence that we usually see for the Justice Department and the attorney general. They want Donald Trump to install a loyal attorney general, install loyal lawyers across the board, and Trump himself has repeatedly said that he wants to do this.

Donald Trump:
""""And I will direct a completely overhauled DOJ to investigate every radical out-of-control prosecutor in America for their illegal, racist and reverse enforcement of the law.""""

Donald Trump:
""""There is no law.""""

And Russ Vought, again, that person, the — who worked in Donald Trump's first administration, likely going to be into any second Donald Trump administration, has said that the Justice Department is not an independent agency. He has said this publicly, and that if anyone were to try to say that they are independent in a second potential Trump term, that he would kick them out of the White House.

The Project 2025 blueprint proposes abolishing the Department of Education, transforming the FBI into a political task force, reinstituting what's known as Schedule F. That's an executive authority that would be instituted by Trump to grow the number of political appointees across the civil service.

And they also want to install roughly 20,000 loyal civil servants across agencies. And they have been preparing for this. Project 2025 leaders have called those loyalists — quote — """"conservative warriors."""" They have called them an army. They have called — of weaponized conservatives.

And they want to essentially make lawyers across all federal agencies, not just the Justice Department, any legal counsel, they want to make them loyal Trump — loyal — loyalists to Trump.

Example:
President Trump talks a lot about the deep state. Again, that is very similar to what authoritarians in other countries have tended to do to justify taking more direct control over civil service systems.
So I think there is a dangerous pattern here, where it would not just reduce the quality of government. It would also open the door for abuses of political power.

Let's not forget what SCOTUS did the other week. The same SCOTUS that was bought and paid for by the architect's,  Heritage Foundation.

The recent Supreme Court decision deciding that President Trump, any president, has some immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts.

Supreme Court decision, could strengthen the basis of Project 2025, which is known as the unitary executive theory, which essentially says that the president has total control over the executive branch, over all the federal agencies.

And the president of The Heritage Foundation, Kevin Roberts, praised that Supreme Court ruling, calling it vital, and said that it was part of a wider conservative reawakening.

Kevin Roberts(architect Project 2025 and Heritage Foundation President) said last week.
 """"The country is in the middle of a second Revolution that will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be.""""

I can go on and on. The red lights are flashing. Fascism is here and we have ONE election to not have democracy be completely destroyed in America. The lead up to the Nazis in Germany is the same lead up that is happening in America right now.

 It's not hyperbole. It can happen here. Start reading everything about Project 2025. Read about how the Nazis got control of Germany. The similarities are striking.

Trump may say he is not a part of it but that man lies as much as he breathes. I have supplied enough examples to prove he is lying and he WILL implement Project 2025 if he gets ahold of the presidency.

It doesn’t stop there, during gym class and recess a group of kids surrounded my daughter and started calling her a communist and throwing sand in her face, she’s 9! She got off the bus today crying her eyes out and doesn’t want to go back to school. 

I called the principal and he said the children involved would face consequences but he was pretty dismissive and rude, he acted like I was wasting his time. 

This is the first time im really considering leaving this state, this is totally unacceptable and now I’m afraid some of these parents are going to slash my tires or that my child will be harmed at school. I can’t believe the state of things, I have lived here all my life and have never had anything like this happen.

Now, in Michigan, I've shot multiple calibers and types 400 yards from another's property and there was no problem.

Is it REALLY that different down there?

Tennessee,1g38s2e,Early voting question?,"My nana had a stroke when I was 4, and she can't talk, she would likely struggle pressing the buttons herself. What are the rules around disability aids and voting? She wants to vote for the first time in a long time, but it's very difficult for her to communicate. She could likely be in the booth alone and figure it out, but I'm not sure if we're allowed to speak for her in the process before that? I hope it isn't too late to get the paperwork we need, if we need it.

edit- I know the registration deadline is past, I got my mom to register her before then. I'm just asking about disability access, like if I would be allowed to go into the booth with her. I'm going to go through the ballot with her beforehand, explain the candidates, and write her responses down, she's able to make those decisions. It's just difficult to communicate. I guess the poll people would just have to take my word for it, in the end, and I understand how that would be a legal/ethical grey area, and I need help knowing what doctors notes we would need. We're in Putnam county, if that matters. She would be present for the whole process, but she tends to get yes/no responses confused. So it's just like, somebody could accuse us of making her answers for her, because it takes a few attempts at clarification to get what she wants figured out.

Her disability presents oddly, as many stroke victims are. Like, my family let her take care of me when I was a kid, and she drove a few times after she wasn't supposed to. She's mentally present, there are just difficult complexities to how she can communicate. It was around the language region of her brain. Like, if she's pissed off, she can get out a full sentence, because that partially comes from a different region of the brain. It's complicated. I guess we should've been asking these questions before Oct. 14th.",1728882998,50,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennessee/comments/1g38s2e/early_voting_question/,23,jack_im_mellow,,,Health,86.5999999999999,323

Tennessee,1ex3aap,I’m tired of seeing our state turn into suburbia.,"So I live in southern middle Tennessee and I’m getting tired of seeing rural/semi-rural areas being turned into suburbia with cookie cutter houses and apartment complexes for miles. If you drive from Columbia to Nashville it’s all starting to blend together. Franklin, springhill, Columbia, Murfreesboro, nolensville is all just suburban sprawl for miles and they’re building more and more and more. It’s starting to creep to our rural areas with these subdivisions popping up and I feel like one day a great majority of our farms and forests will be gone to houses shoved right on top of each other. I also never hear any politician speak about this problem, instead many encourage people to move here. We at least need some sort of zoning county wide that leaves some counties as pure farming/industry/resource based and the others to have their suburban sprawl so it doesn’t spread throughout the entire state. I honestly don’t know how something like this ever gets fixed, it’s corporations that are buying the land and building left and right everywhere you look. I just want to keep our rural areas rural where farming and wildlife can thrive.

That is all. Please vote people. For your moms, sisters, aunts, daughters, and other women that you care about. They deserve the right to not be afraid of dying because of stupid laws. Go vote and take some friends and family with you.

Last election this neighborhood was full of Trump flags and Trump signs. Occasionally there was a Biden sign but not often. So far this year I have seen one Trump flag and one Kamala sign. Not sure this means anything but I don't think people are as excited about Trump as they were four years ago.

Texas,18go18m,An example of how bad the atmosphere/mood has gotten in Texas.,"I live in Austin.  For years people have posted in our sub asking if they should move here.  Every time there are a lot of responses complaining about the weather, the cost of living, the traffic - but also a lot of people talking about how much they love it here and encouraging the person to come.  

Today [a young woman posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/18geuwl/should_a_young_woman_of_reproductive_age_move_to/) saying she really wants to move here but the Kate Cox story has her worried - she asked for opinions. 

Hundreds of responses - every single one I read said don't do it.  There were responses from people who already moved away, from people planning on moving away, from people who want to move away, and people thinking about whether they should move away.

Women who were worried about what to do if they get an unplanned and unwanted pregnancy, but also women who plan to get pregnant and worry about not being able to get life saving procedures if something goes wrong with that pregnancy.   

And there's no change in sight - three more years before there's even a chance of voting them out, and unlike other states Texas won't let voters put a constitutional amendment on the ballot, that can only be done by the legislature.  So much for democracy.


EDIT:  Someone pointed out, there are some important elections - like Texas Supreme Court - next year.

EDIT2:  Yes, plenty of people love is here, and plenty are moving here (although that's slowing down) -- the point is that Texas was a very popular place with people across the spectrum.  Now a lot of people are feeling very uncomfortable with changes here.",1702393799,8723,https://www.reddit.com/r/texas/comments/18go18m/an_example_of_how_bad_the_atmospheremood_has/,2029,weluckyfew,,,International Affairs and Trade,754.2,8843.8

Texas,1eswgf7,The GOP Endorses Stolen Valor,"In the current political climate it seems important to call out the party for the same issues they call others out for.

My current US Representative is Ronny Jackson, a man who was demoted from Rear Admiral to Captain for misconduct. 

Source: https://www.texastribune.org/2024/03/07/ronny-jackson-white-house-navy-demoted/

Ronny is himself very involved in the Trump-Vance campaign which has been going very hard on Walz for misrepresenting his rank.

Another thing Congressman Jackson has done is call out Kamala Harris for not """"answering tough questions that the American people deserve answers to!!""""

His tweet: https://x.com/RonnyJacksonTX/status/1823780918265258090?t=1q9TMjHeqUQYO0SYs8BptA&s=19

However, Congressman Jackson has refused to answer why he lies about his rank on multiple occasions when I have contacted his office. 

The purpose of this post is entirely to highlight the hypocrisy of the Texas GOP and their politicians, because I have not found evidence of a single member of the GOP speaking out against Congressman Jackson's lies.",1723731716,3241,https://www.reddit.com/r/texas/comments/1eswgf7/the_gop_endorses_stolen_valor/,226,Wym,,,Defense and National Security,754.2,8843.8

The LDS make up less than 50% of State of Utah's population, yet it mathematically seems it's almost impossible to get elected to anything above dog-catcher unless you're LDS.

My post isnt meant to be """"anti-LDS"""", some of the nicest people I've ever met since moving here are LDS, including beloved neighbors I'm friends with now, but I'm frustrated by how they seem to have an almost totalitarian 100% grip on power, which leads to some terribly nearsighted policy.

For instance, I'm a beer lover (I even like to brew my own beers), and it is literally **ILLEGAL** for me to have a keg, even as a legal adult in the privacy of my own home! The only state in America like this.  It's........... insane.

Vermont,1859lhe,"Urgent Request, Need Kidney Donor","I know it is a big ask, but thank you for even hearing and considering my request.

I’m a father of 3 kids living my family and have been fighting kidney failure since my diagnosis in 2005. My health has deteriorated to the stage where I am now in a desperate need of a kidney donor for my kidney transplant. This transplant will allow me to live and see my kids marry and play with grandkids.

If you or someone is willing to consider a kidney donation, you’d be saving my life - hope someone out there can help. Please reach out to 914-468-4191 or [Radhea2002@yahoo.com](mailto:Radhea2002@yahoo.com) and can discuss all details.

I'm **Blood Type O,** so anyone with type O (+ or -) can donate to me directly and if you're not type O, you can donate on my behalf in a paired exchange where you donate to a matching recipient and I receive one from another donor matching mine. This helps both recipients and in some cases a larger group in a donor chain. Donors can be from anywhere in the US.

Just a few quick notes / FAQs:

*  The procedure being in practice for a very long time, causes no long term disadvantage to donor’s health in most cases , whilst allowing you to save the life of another person.
* The cost of your evaluation and surgery will be covered by my insurance. The hospital can give you extensive information on this.
* Donor’s testing/ travel expenses and lost wages are covered by various programs.
* You will have a separate team of healthcare professionals to evaluate you as a living donor. Their job is to help you understand the risks and benefits and look out for your best interests.",1701109093,263,https://www.reddit.com/r/vermont/comments/1859lhe/urgent_request_need_kidney_donor/,17,ComplexNo7324,,,Health,100,303

btw, we first tried to do this through a local dealer who had one car in inventory. After a month of trying, they couldn't manage the paperwork. Alderman's in Rutland has literal rows of Cali lease Bolts to choose from, and everything sailed through in an afternoon.

Do you wish that train travel in Vermont was faster, more frequent, and went more places?

If you have time, submit your comments (or grievances) with Amtrak in this state, and potentially help make it better!

Vermont,18jcnv2,HUD released part 1 of its Annual Homelessness Report today. Vermont has the second highest homelessness rate in the country.,"The PDF of the full Part 1: Point in Time Estimates is the first link at this site:

https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/ahar/2023-ahar-part-1-pit-estimates-of-homelessness-in-the-us.html

Below are a few key points and some thoughts.

_______________________________________________________________

Vermont has the second highest homelessness per capita rate, just slightly lower than New York.

""""States with very high rates of overall experiences of homelessness included New York, Vermont,
Oregon, and California, with 52, 51, 48, and 46 people experiencing homelessness for every
10,000 people in the state.""""

Vermont experienced the largest percentage increase in homelessness from 2007 to 2023 at 218%, followed by Montana (89%), and New York (65%).

""""•Vermont experienced the largest percentage increase in experiences of family homelessness since
the pandemic began, increasing by 213% (794 more people) since 2020, the last count before the
pandemic.

• Over a longer period, 2007-2023, experiences of family homelessness increased in only 6 states.
The largest numerical increases were in New York (19,150 more people, or 55%), Massachusetts
(6,047 more people or 89%), Maine (798 more people or 53%), and Vermont (730 more people or
167%).""""

______________________________________________________________

There's a portion of this that would lend one to try to find a bright spot here:
""""Two states sheltered at least 95 percent of people experiencing homelessness: Vermont (96%)
and New York (95%).""""

However, the data in this analysis was collected in January, at the height of the motel program. The shelter rates have most certainly dropped since then. (There is a claim by some that the motel program only induced an influx of homeless people from other states seeking temporary shelter. This theory is unsupported by any data, and is contradicted by reports provided to the legislature by DCF.)

Additionally, in January VERAP was still providing benefits at that time to the lowest income Vermonters, and non-payment evictions have rose since that program ended. I would very much expect that the numbers are worse now than this report even shows.

What the shelter rate date tells me is that we're capable of establishing decent short term remedies, but have failed to institute long term solutions to the state's housing crises. 

Vermont is a small state, but not so small that this data is anomalous. The homelessness crisis in this state is even worse than many people realize, and it's bad throughout the state, not just in Chittenden county.",1702680792,161,https://www.reddit.com/r/vermont/comments/18jcnv2/hud_released_part_1_of_its_annual_homelessness/,77,Goldentongue,,,Health,100,303

2)  If you're driving well below the speed limit, I go to pass, and you suddenly discover a new gear or find your gas pedal and speed up to match my speed while I'm passing in the oncoming lane, fuck you for being aggressive and dangerous.  I WILL slam on the gas enough to get past you, cut you off, and slow you back down to the speed limit before going on my way.",1728318617,197,https://www.reddit.com/r/vermont/comments/1fybxqb/two_thoughts_on_2lane_road_passing/,98,LakeMonsterVT,,,Transportation and Infrastructure,100,303

When we reached her we plied her with drink and electrolytes and in time she stabilised to the point that she could walk. She carefully picked her way down Sunset Ridge on angry knees, supported by us and eyeing the litter that Underhill and Jericho Fire Department had brought up, just in case. With rests and encouragement she was able to make it down under her own steam, much to everyone’s relief. The takeaways? Be aware of heat exhaustion which if untreated can lead to heat stroke.

Virginia,1fyvqzk,Kamala Harris: Virginia is the only state in the south not banning abortions,"Candidate Kamala Harris guested on Call Her Daddy ([Vice President Kamala Harris](https://youtu.be/_KCRsjPCiCI?si=_nrbZpVLe-Yb9BV7)). KH mentions Virginia at [2:11](https://youtu.be/_KCRsjPCiCI?si=TpYnHA4xovhHUbts&t=131).

  
Why this matters: As a state resident, I am proud we've not banned abortions. From a human perspective, it puts into context how awful it must be for a woman living in the south -- who, as Harris points out, must do something alone and typically far from home and her support system -- to get an abortion.

In general it seems like people do prefer the rising summer (very understandable, PNW summers are the best summers!) but somewhat surprisingly, there are a few who share my sentiment. Like many here, I don't have central AC, so comfort is not a flip of the switch. I do have portable ACs but there is inertia in setting it up until the forecast calls for a string of 90F + days. Suddenly there are more of everything (people, cars, bikes, kids, bugs) and much less space for pensive, reflective strolls.

Washington,1ecboyn,The rent crisis in Washington is so bad it didn't even fully hit me until now,"Warning: little bit of doomposting ahead

So for context: I just started working a new job that gives me either 32 or 40hrs per week, and pays $17.50 per hour, (slightly above minimum wage), but I was already applying to other jobs so I also interviewed on my first day and landed another job that will make me $16.25 and $23 per hour depending on tips, (to emphasize my point I'm going to assume $23 per hour), and 20hrs per week.

I've also been looking at apartments, and  found one that's 1 bed, 1 bath, and around 570 square feet, (Average sqft of a 1 bedroom is anywhere from 500 to 1000.) It's rent assisted which takes a few hundred dollars off the rent price. And as an important note, this apartment is one of the cheapest I found in my area, I'm not just pointing out a more expensive small apartment to make a point.

So I did the math, and including the rent assistance, assuming $23/hr at my tipped job, and assuming i get 40hrs per week at my main job, (total *60* hours per week), I would still not be able to make 3x rent.

Rent is so dramatically bloated, in fact, that if I did make 3x rent I would be putting away more than the cost of rent into savings every single month after expenses, (with my expenses including subscription services and the money I spend to make sure one of my friends a doesn't run out of food.)

Anyway, point of this is to say: when you're voting for governor this year maybe do some research and make sure their policies on property tax and rent control align with your interests.

Good day y'all

Had dinner at a great Chinese restaurant in Ohio. The next day we drove to Rainelle and spent a day in nature. The following day was a drive up to Morgantown to hang out and spend the night. The next day was spent in the Parkersburg area, which was followed by a final day in Charleston. This is just a quick summary of the areas that we drove to and spent time at. To say West Virginia is beautiful is an understatement, the mountains I can still see in my mind so clearly. But the people were so kind and lovely. What a sense of community and pride. Everywhere we went we connected with somebody. So polite and hospitable so eager to share great stories. I'm home in California laying down getting ready for bed and I had to urge to let everyone in West Virginia they can see this know that you guys have a beautiful state and are such lovely, caring kind, and proud people.

WestVirginia,1cqbhc7,I’m a former Californian who has lived in West Virginia for two years now. Here is why I prefer West Virginia over California,"I grew up in a small town named Moraga 30 minutes from Oakland, CA. It was nice until the last three years where I and the rest of my family started to notice how fake and for a lack of a better term, snobby people were. Ironically around this time was when we began looking at options for universities for me to attend, and one school that offered an amazing natural resources program was none other than Marshall University, only problem at the time was that it was in a state I saw as ‘maga’ and too conservative. 

Out of curiosity, I and my mother decided to visit the campus in Huntington. I would be lying to myself if I said I weren’t nervous to visit such a different place. Our country already being as divided as it is today, I didn’t anticipate an entirely warm welcome from the locals once they knew I was from the bluest state in the country.

Here is where my world turned around.

The kindness my mother and I were greeted with was overwhelming, and nothing like we have ever experienced during our ten years in California. A man walked all the way across a parking lot to help us load a couch into our car when we were moving furniture into our house, and that is something that just didn’t happen back in California.

A lot of this eased the hostility I had towards conservatives, and killed my belief that ALL conservatives are unhinged lunatics (there are a lot of them still in my opinion), and I became more open and comfortable talking to people I know are conservative and one can be without all the aggression which back then seemed impossible.

With the upcoming election and primaries around the corner, I wanted to share my view of this state as an outsider and can only hope that the next couple of years won’t turn the loving people of West Virginia against each other.

PS: there are many many many more reasons why we left Cali, but for me, the hospitality West Virginia had was too good to put aside.",1715530628,233,https://www.reddit.com/r/WestVirginia/comments/1cqbhc7/im_a_former_californian_who_has_lived_in_west/,220,Dunkkerrs,,,Health,65,234.3

WestVirginia,1cbhj2x,"I’m at a crossroads, and my heart is heavy.","[25M] — I just feel trapped, here. I’m making $15.75 an hour and I’m struggling. Even with low rent, I’m struggling. I look around for jobs, granted I only have a diploma, and it’s just all low paying shit, man. There seems to be no opportunity, here. 

I’m well traveled. From Dallas to NYC to Miami and Chicago, and all sorts of places in between. 

And it breaks my heart that all of these places I’ve been— just seem better than West Virginia. Besides Michigan and maybe St. Louis, everywhere I go, I just think to myself: “Man, this is better than West Virginia”. And I hate that. It hurts. 

My family is here. My friends are here. My heart is here. These hills are so beautiful, and the skies are painted with a feeling of comfort. 

I was driving home from Indiana the other day, had just come from Illinois. I remember thinking: “Man, there’s just so much more out here than West Virginia”, and I was honestly feeling bittersweet about entering the WV state line. Bitter was the feeling that I was going back to the place that had so little, that I felt stuck in. Sweet was the feeling of finally being home in the hills, where my heart lie. 

I don’t know what to do. I think I need to prepare to say goodbye to West Virginia. 

Edit: I just want to say, I really appreciate all the comments being left on this post. Leave it to West Virginians to be so kind. Its hard coming to terms and realizing that I’m eventually going to have to up and leave. I have $1,000 of debt to pay off, and after that— it’s time to buckle down and start spreading my wings to fly away. Thank you all, seriously. I needed the kind words and the encouragement.

WestVirginia,1f6ab7l,"A story about why WV is amazing…..and Thank You, Bub and Brittany!!","So yesterday my family did what we love to do on a summer Saturday, which is float down the Cacapon River.   I have 3 young daughters, so most of the time my wife and I use rope and kayaks to tow 2 of them in tubes, the other is solo on a kids kayak.    We have probably done this 50+ times at this point and generally speaking we know what we’re doing and are not total morons…….most of the time

If anyone knows Great Cacapon well, we planned to take out at the low water bridge on Rockford Road.   Wed put in at our community access point about 4 miles up river, planning on around a 2 hour float with some time built in for swimming and general leisure.   There were potential storms in the forecast but we thought we had PLENTY of time.   

Well, long story short, we did not.   Basically, we were within a half mile of my truck, and were all basically paddling as fast as we could when Armageddon hit us.   My 2 oldest daughters were completely panicked and my wife and youngest daughter, who were around 30-40 yards behind us when the first drops came, were now nowhere to be seen.   This was a SERIOUS thunderstorm and it came quick and furious. 

So my 8 year old is in a state of absolute panic and I’m trying to keep everyone calm while we’re paddling for shore.   Out of nowhere (couldn’t really see anything beyond 100-120 ft or so) an ATV rolls right up to the river bank, and a guy is yelling at top of his lungs and motioning us in.    I was headed for the riverbank anyways, but with no plan for shelter other than getting under a tree.   I just knew I had to get my kids out of the water, and then find my wife and youngest immediately.   I was almost certain about where my wife would’ve put in and gotten out of the water to try to ride it out, but since I didn’t see them do it myself I was panicked.

Guy on the ATV gets my kids and I up to a covered barn area about 50-60 yards from the bank of the river, where his wife and kids are waiting for us with towels.   She had apparently seen us out on the water and they sprung into action.   

So we get a very warm welcome and greeting but they can see how frantic we are and I immediately tell them I have to go find my wife.   I cannot emphasize enough how severe the storm was at this point.   Blinding sheets of rain, thunder booming all over the place.   As soon as I say this, the guy is immediately back on his ATV racing to where I thought they might be, with me pretty much running after him.

This is where it gets ridiculous (if it wasn’t already).   We get around 200 yards down the road (he’s now pretty well ahead of me)….and as he zooms by my wife and youngest daughter come walking out from the thin strip of woods that’s between the river and Rockford Rd.   It was raining so hard and was so loud that the guy on the ATV couldn’t hear me yelling for him that we’d found them, so he had kept going.    

My wife is obviously shaken, my 5 year old is hysterical…..so I carry my 5 year old back to the barn where this unbelievably nice family is still waiting with my other 2 kids, keeping them warm and just being overall as kind as  humanly possible.  

So now I have my whole family safe and sound, but this guy doesn’t know this so he is out on the ATV in beyond hellish conditions looking for my family.   I’m like “I gotta go back out to tell him everything’s OK”, and his wife just refuses to let me do that.  “He’s already wet”, and “this is fun to him” we’re here lines I believe.

Thankfully he came back before long, just laughs at what had happened and him being yards past when my wife had popped out by the roadside, and then offers to take me to get my truck!   I’m really in no position to say no, so we drive down to bridge, he drops me off, I get my truck to take back to where my family was, and as I’m pulling off the road I see that this man has GONE BACK DOWN TO THE RIVER AND CARRIED OUR 2 KAYAKS BACK UP TO THE ROADSIDE!!

Then, and I swear to God I’m not making this up, he asks if we drink, we say hell yes, and gives us a pull from his Peach Crown (was damn good).

After we actually properly introduced ourselves, we discovered that it was Robert (Bub) on the ATV and Brittany was the angel with the towels and smiles who stayed with my kids while I was frantically looking for my wife.   

Bub and Brittany’s kindness, neighborliness, generosity, and willingness to go miles and miles out of their way to step out into utter misery in order to help out complete strangers for no credit or publicity whatsoever is something I honestly will never forget.   I hope I can somehow come close to paying it forward.

Thank you Bub and Brittany.   Y’all helped us out tremendously yesterday.   More importantly you taught my children a lesson about compassion and how to be a good person that I’ll make sure they never ever forget!!

I truly believe that West Virginia folks are a special breed and I do my best to be a good representative for our state.

Wisconsin,1alad87,Dear Fellow Wisconsin Left-leaners-,"Allow me to be perfectly clear: I recognize and despise that our current federal government is actively funding and assisting in an attempted genocide of the Palestinian people. I hate it with everything that I am. Sadly, I've got too much life here in America. My nice house, my beautiful wife, my precious daughter, my paid off car... I'm too much of a coward to give it all up and do something about it through joining some humanitarian effort or any number of things that I could do instead of continuing to live my peaceful life here.

That said, as a key swing state voter, the answer to my hopelessness and rage and self-loathing is *NOT* to invite Donald goddamn Trump back to power. I won't let the country I've brought my daughter into become a police state where anyone who steps outside of the mythological """"Ideal American"""" (White, Straight, Cis, Mongamous, Evengelical Christian et al.) stereotype is immediately and ruthlessly diminished. If you have a neurodivergent child, if you have a queer sibling, if you have that one Black friend, if you give even the littlest amount of crap about anyone with a uterus, you will be prioritizing your own discomfort with your own laziness and cowardice, and not your loved ones by refusing to vote for Biden in November.

I hate it too. I promise I do. But inviting a hypernationalist, theocratically guided government here, to open up the possibility of attempted genocide *here* is not the damn answer.",1707331760,749,https://www.reddit.com/r/wisconsin/comments/1alad87/dear_fellow_wisconsin_leftleaners/,990,SWRamblings,,,Defense and National Security,261,1682.1

Wisconsin,1emu8pf,Went to the Kamala/Walz Rally Today,"The biggest motivation in going to the rally was to take my daughter and show her that she actually could be president one day if she wanted to. But, what I was most struck by was the fact that Kamala and Tim were both capable of actually giving a speech *while* interacting with the crowd. It was such a relief. Of course, everyone has seen Tim Walz stopping in the middle of his speech to acknowledge the person needing assistance. But, there were a few off-the-cuff moments for Kamala as well. For example, she stopped mid speech to respond to a person in the crowd with """"We will let the courts deal with that, our job is to hold Trump accountable at the ballot box"""" (or something like that) It was such a breath of fresh air. Competent and coherent intelligent people addressing a crowd. It was like taking a time machine to when candidates from both parties were actually promoting and explaining policy instead of spouting bumper sticker slogans. Previously, I was anybody but Trump. Now, I'm fully on board with Kamala/Walz. This isn't a Band-Aid. It's the real deal.

**MADISON, Wis.** — A [bombshell report](https://wisdems.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=5fdce0a26f89c28febc13998d&id=cdf93e21fd&e=bc56144430) this morning from Dan Bice of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel revealed that Banco Azteca, a bank reportedly tied to the Mexican cartel flew $26 million of cash across the U.S.-Mexico Border to Eric Hovde’s bank in California.

As the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel [detailed](https://wisdems.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=5fdce0a26f89c28febc13998d&id=de4c36d48f&e=bc56144430), Banco Azteca was **cut off by several other U.S. banks over “risk and compliance concerns” after reporting linked it to cartel activity.** An executive of the bank was recently implicated in a federal indictment detailing his attempts to bribe a member of the U.S. Congress to get U.S. banks to once again do business with the bank. **Despite this, Eric Hovde’s bank flew $26 million of cash from Mexico City to Irvine, California as part of a deal with Banco Azteca last December.**

This shocking revelation comes as Hovde has [refused to disclose](https://wisdems.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=5fdce0a26f89c28febc13998d&id=bc70010d55&e=bc56144430) which foreign banks and governments his bank has [done](https://wisdems.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=5fdce0a26f89c28febc13998d&id=968de2de39&e=bc56144430) millions of dollars of business with. **What else is Hovde hiding?**

Banco Azteca, the 10th largest financial institution in Mexico, has had its share of problems in recent years.  
  
Accused in past news stories of having links to the Mexican drug cartel.  
  
Dropped as a financial partner by some U.S. banks because of """"risk and compliance concerns.""""  
And now caught up in a Texas bribery scheme with an American congressman.  
  
But Sunwest Bank, the Utah-based financial institution run by Republican U.S. Senate candidate Eric Hovde, doesn't mind doing business with it.  
  
In December, Banco Azteca sent $26.2 million in cash to Sunwest on four airplane flights as part of a massive currency conversion called """"repatriation,"""" records show. Hovde, who is running against Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, is chairman and CEO of Sunwest.

Wyoming,1altuxw,"‘A Palpable Fear of Even Letting Your Friends Know You Are a Democrat’ - In deep red Wyoming, a Democratic Party organizer says inflamed political tensions are his greatest hurdle.",">President Joe Biden isn’t going to win Wyoming in 2024 — and he doesn’t have to in order to hold the White House. But if Democrats don’t stop hemorrhaging support in rural areas, it could cost them in some of the key swing states they do need in November.

>Party officials are well aware of that dynamic. Since 2021, the national Democratic Party has invested millions of dollars in a “Red State Fund” to build out organizing in Republican strongholds. The Biden administration has also made huge investments in rural America through rural cooperatives and the bipartisan infrastructure law, which the president and his cabinet secretaries highlighted last fall on a two-week tour.

>Is any of it making an impact? I called up Greg Haas, the organizing director of the Wyoming Democratic Party, who said that it’s hard to break through to voters even with tangible projects.
“People are so interested in the hot-button things,” he said in an interview with POLITICO Magazine. “Right now one of the parties is spending most of the time talking about the ‘invasion’ at the southern border.”

>Republicans have dominated the state for years — including well before Donald Trump won over 70 percent of the vote in 2020 — so Wyoming Democrats have long faced a steep journey back to relevancy. But lately, Haas said, his difficulty in building support for Democrats has gone beyond a tough national climate or the state’s conservative lean.

>Instead, the biggest challenge in organizing on the ground is America’s increasingly toxic political culture.

>**From your perspective organizing in Wyoming, why do you think Democrats have struggled to compete in rural communities?**

>Something I’ve experienced traveling around the state is that there is a palpable fear of even letting your friends know you are a Democrat, or even in line with what Democratic politicians are doing. There’s vandalism that takes place here, and people are scared of that. Having your yard sign stolen or your flag taken down is one thing, but having your car keyed or trash left in your yard, that’s another. I know people who have been harassed after they are outed as a Democrat, and then people give them trouble. People hear those stories. They’re not fake. They’re not made up. I’ve seen and heard some really ugly language.

>As a group, we are vilified. There’s a vocal part of the other political parties that makes up lies and says things about the Democratic Party to demonize us. There are Democrats who demonize other political parties, too. All of that tension leaves a bad taste in other people’s mouths. Most of us in Wyoming — people who are reasonable and love their state and their community — aren’t interested in just butting heads and this adversarial hatemongering. Nobody likes this angry style of dehumanizing communication.

…

>**Do you have any strategies for organizing under such difficult conditions?**

>I have mixed results! My most successful way of overcoming that fear is through getting together to act together. So many rural Democrats feel like we are in a closet and we are on our own. We feel that people will hate us. If people feel like they can join this group, and by joining that group they are afforded some amount of protection, that can be appealing to people who feel like they have no voice. Joining the party can also give people a shield. Getting rural Democrats to know they are not alone can be satisfying and is central to the work that I do.

…

>**Wyoming last had a Democratic governor — Dave Freudenthal — back in 2011. He was a conservative Democrat. Now, it’s not even close, a Democratic governor would have no shot. Why has that happened?**

>Well, there’s a lot of fear. There’s a lot of misinformation.

>The world market is changing, and there’s a lot of people who — right or wrong — they feel like their livelihood is being threatened. And I think it’s easier to blame a group than it is to say, “Oh, it’s the market deciding that,” especially if you’re a pro-free market person always saying let the market decide.

>There are more and more people who are really afraid of what’s going to happen to their family ranch, or am I going to lose my job? And when people are that scared, I think as humans we have a tendency to find somebody to blame. And there are a lot of toxic elements in our culture, that have risen in strength and a lot of poisonous ways of thinking about the other person. … You know, “This person that doesn’t look like me or the people I grew up with is either going to take my job, or my kids’ job, or they’re just going to mooch off or get everything for free.”

>**Are there certain issues that really motivate people to come out, organize and join their local Democratic Party in Wyoming?**

>The important things for Democrats are fully funded public education, people being treated equally and freedom being afforded to all people. It’s also pretty important to a lot of people in Wyoming, Democrats or otherwise, that women have the right to control their own bodies and their health care and that agency isn’t taken away from them. Climate matters to a lot of people, not in terms of climate change necessarily, but clean air and clean water.
