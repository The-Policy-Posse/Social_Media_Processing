18kzmtc,Can we bring back waving?,"I grew up in a rural (really really rural) area of VT and when you walk down your dirt road, you wave at the people in the cars who pass. This is normal. You do a little flick of the hand and the person driving does like 3 fingers off the wheel. 

All through my childhood and early adulthood, I loved that! Every time I took a walk, the person who passed me in a car would wave and vice versa. 

But in the last few years it hasn't really happened a lot. 

I'm not talking about montpelier or burlington (big cities lol) 

I'm saying small dirt roads in the really rural areas. I would love to bring that back. It's just a little expression of community and I miss it!

194v9o0,6 Vermont troopers placed on leave as nature of internal investigation remains under wraps,"From my perspective, there has been nothing but embarrassment after shameful embarrassment from Vermont law enforcement for years now. Years. State Troopers committing crimes, state troopers going on racist tirades while playing online games, sheriffs charged with battery, sheriffs charged with sexual abuse and kidnapping, a Rutland cop getting in a drunken shootout in NY, all the nonsense in St Albans with the cops partying and sneaking away to hookup and having affairs while on duty… it is all grotesquely embarrassing and shameful, and that’s just what I can recall off the top of my head. These are the people society tells us we are supposed to teach our kids to look up to. 

Listen man, I know folks get super triggered by words like “defund” but holy crap something needs to change here.

Later, I was at the register paying for my towels and I see the woman out of the corner of my eye. She had a shopping cart overflowing with stuff and she was walking past the cashier line and heading toward the door. 

Another woman went ahead of her as a lookout and they both dashed out. The cashier looked up, shrugged, and said, “That was ballsy,” and finished checking me out like it was no big deal.
