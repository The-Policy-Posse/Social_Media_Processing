Deputy party leader Marjorie Taylor Green recently confirmed on X (love you Elon!) what we all had suspected: Hurricane Milton was created by Democrats using advanced military technology to steal the election. As Alaskans, we know this means HAARP, just as we know the Republican party to be an irrefutable source of truth which should never be questioned.

But it still left me wondering how exactly do they create the hurricane using HAARP? According to wikipedia, HAARP is run by a well-known CIA/DoD front organization, the University of Alaska Fairbanks. It uses high frequency transmitters to excite the atmosphere. But my question is, how does exciting the atmosphere above Fairbanks cause a hurricane all the way down in Florida? And how do they make it so it only targets Republicans?

Does anyone like maybe a physicist or someone who was employed at UAF know how this whole thing works? I tried to do my own research by ordering Begich Sr.'s book from Nick's web site, but they said it was out of print (almost certainly due to CIA interference). Also, does anyone know if this could be connected to the wind storm that ripped the roof off my house a few winters back? Cause my insurance guy will want to know.","Alaska","How did Joe Biden use HAARP to create Hurricane Milton?",60.3,343.3,"Environment and Natural Resources","2024-11-13T03:47:42.573700Z","https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1g08idk/how_did_joe_biden_use_haarp_to_create_hurricane/"

I personally think that's a big deal. We as voters can express more nuanced views of candidates and we can express dissatisfaction with mainstream candidates by pushing them down the list rather than sacrificing our ballots to make a point.

Let's say you're a libertarian or a green party voter, you can actually vote for your party as your first choice and then choose from the rest of the ticket. Your 3rd and 4th choice preference could really makes a difference this year.

I love that this system allows more nuance and more choice for voters. And it doesn't lock us in so much to the two party system. Alaska is a state where 63.9% of voters don't belong to one of the two major parties so I see this as a very good thing.

Vote no on 2 and be prepared to rank your presidential picks at the ballot box.

Born and raised on Oahu, live on the continent now and occasionally visit home to see family. I sometimes feel like I don’t recognize home anymore. Everything looks different, but I also feel like there’s been a vibe shift.. like people are just nastier and more self-focused overall. Not saying this is coming solely from transplants but I feel like that has a lot to do with it. There are so many more new people here post-Covid. 

I was at the grocery store the other day and this lady who was clearly a transplant was blocking the aisle with her cart while she was stooped over sticking out her big behind looking at something on the shelf. I said “excuse me” in a polite way (not rude or snarky) and walked in front of her bc there was literally no other way to get past. I didn’t have a cart or anything, simply walked in front of her. She went crazy and called me a “stupid fucking bitch” and yelled that I could have walked behind her (there was literally no room). I was like wtf? She was SO angry for no reason. I told her that this wasn’t the continent and she shouldn’t talk like that here and she was like “I’ve been here longer than you!” 🙄🤮I’m not a confrontational person so I just walked away but the interaction threw me off so much.

Then a couple days later at Costco I saw an old guy who was also clearly not local yell at a kid for bumping into his cart. He called him a jackass and was raising his voice and demanding an apology.

Lastly, I ordered a box from Farmlink and went to get it at the pickup spot. I was in line waiting for the worker when this lady comes and cuts in front of me and asks about her box, then walks over to the employee-only area, opens the fridge and moves around all the boxes looking for hers, grabs it, and walks away. The worker and I just exchange looks like wth was that. A couple minutes later she’s near me while I’m moving stuff from the box to my bag (so they can reuse the box) and I notice she has a tote bag from a store in SF. I ask if she’s from SF and she smiles and says yes and asks if I am too. I said no and she says that she just moved here. I wanted to be like “I can tell” but didn’t say anything. 

Anyway, I just feel like… grossed out by all these interactions and low key am wondering what Hawaii will look like in another 20 years. It just feels like these people don’t get it and I hate the thought of more of them moving here. I’ve also noticed that when I’m on a plane with mostly non-local people that everyone is in a free for all to get off the plane first. Does anyone else notice that? Just total cultural differences… they’re so entitled and have no sense of community. Not saying ALL new residents are like that, but a lot certainly seem to be, enough that it’s noticeable. Also, I’m not racist and am not anti-haole, but for context, yes they were all white. 

Edit: I’m not saying locals are incapable of this sort of behavior and that every single new resident is like this. My point is that this behavior unfortunately isn’t uncommon and it coincides with our home undergoing many changes to the culture and lifestyle. Some of it is just the times. But it’s also true that many local families are struggling and more locals are moving away, while more people from elsewhere are coming in. If you’re triggered by me saying this you’re probably part of the problem.

In 2008, Iowa voted blue for Obama. We can absolutely get there again!!

Two days ago I had a frank conversation with my late-80’s grandmother and asked her to reconsider voting for Donald Trump. I told her that I hope she’ll be here for a long time yet, but that I was scared that putting him in office will have ramifications that will last the rest of my lifetime. I told her that what he brings to the table were things I absolutely do not want.  I asked her to give real thought and consideration before she votes for Trump and the world she’ll be signing me up for by doing so. 

She told me that she couldn’t bring herself to vote for Harris, but that she would honor the future that I want to inherit and will not be casting a vote this year. Not for Trump. That means the world to me. 

If you have people that you love who will hold their nose and vote for Trump, talk to them. Tell them that you love them and you’re scared. Ask them to give thought to their vote before casting it.

We had the chance to work together as fellow governors, and while we come from different parties, I have always appreciated his dedication to public service.

I guess I’m venting because this has occupied so much of my mind recently. I don’t want it to, but I do not believe an election has been this divided and “in your face” since I’ve been alive.

This defense has been used at least 351 times in homicide trials, according to researchers, and has often led to reduced sentences. Now, Minnesota becomes the 19th state to bar such defenses.

The bill states that the use of force against a person in reaction to their sexual orientation or gender identity is prohibited. It also specifies that it is not a defense to any crime that the defendant acted """"based on the discovery of, knowledge about, or disclosure of"""" a victim's LGBTQ+ status.

Conservative lawmakers want to take away our public lands and sell them to private interests, without any interest in conservation or regulation. Imagine a future where Minnesotans, or Americans at large, can no longer enjoy the majesty that is the BWCA, because the land has been leased to logging, mining, and fracking companies.

I implore everyone to look into Project 2025. It affects us so much more than just our national parks and forests, but I feel that should be a point hammered home to Minnesotans, who hold our parks and public lands as a point of state pride.

Anyways, lesbian lady is fired. Apparently for the tapes and for watching porn and junk on state issued devices. (Btw if that’s how we get cops fired? I want an audit of EVERY officer and troopers search history. REINSTATE HER!)

As we pulled out of Starbucks, we took a moment to look at the roller coaster from a distance. I saw there was parking lot that would open up to the back of the roller coaster, So we decided to head over and check it out (this was before I googled and found it had been out of service for awhile) We found a car parked in the back that seemed beat up. Upon closer inspection, the car had a note on it with bright orange paper. There was a construction hat in the windshield and that was all we could see from driving by.  My mom wanted to check it out because we couldn’t see the writing and I was noooot into that.  We both have Fire and EMS background so there was a little concern someone may need help.

She checked the note and I, the backseats. There was nobody in the back and the note said the car had broken down and someone would be back for it. Normal enough. What’s not normal is that after we got back in the car and started driving out, an all white pickup truck came racing up behind us in this parking lot and getting close enough to hit us. We were really confused and made a move to get the hell out of there because it felt like…intimidation? I thought it also might’ve been a teenager or something dicking around but I wasn’t taking chances. The truck turned a corner, and was in the normal flow of traffic away from us. 

When leaving that lot, we passed by a casino directly leaving the roller coaster lot. There were two huge semi trucks backed into the loading bay of this casino, both Pepsi big haulers unloading. This will be important later. When we went to leave to get back on the road to Vegas, there were two White trucks tinted windows and no license plates (same as the one before) in the parking lot nearest to us facing the road to turn. When we went straight to get onto the roundabout, they followed. We went around TWICE and they followed. By this point, we were a little freaked but not into being intimidated and a little dumb probably. We decided to park in the big mall to see if they were cops and maybe were wanting to talk to us. Soon as we parked, they passed and left the mall lot. We couldn’t see either of them the windows were so dark. 

We went into the mall. We were both a little freaked and wanted to ask some questions to the workers as they were probably local. This mall was definitely dead. We went into Tommy Bahama, and talked to the clerk about the deal with the roller coaster. She said it’s hasn’t been up and running for a while. I asked her why there were two casinos right across from each other, she said the roof partially collapsed on one of them and left it unusable for a while and that she didn’t know why there were two but that it was a good idea given only one works. I asked her which one collapsed, she told me the one closest to the roller coaster.  

The same casino that was partially collapsed is the one that I saw had two semis backed into the loading dock with people actively unloading things. Why would there be two semis with workers unloading from a “Pepsi” truck into a non working casino? We left the mall, got into the car to leave for Vegas as we had been in Primm for about an hour. Driving away, there were Two white pickups, and a small white car quite literally pulling into the lot as we are leaving, turning around driving in a line and followed us to the roundabout to get onto the on ramp. Once we got onto the highway, they did not follow and stayed on the roundabout. 

Listen, is there some shady shit going on over there or were people just fucking with us? I think about this a lot and my mom and I have talked about it quite a bit. It’s been awhile but it won’t leave my mind. ","Nevada","Stopped in Primm NV, it was one of the weirdest experiences I’ve had.

I moved here for work after school and I have just never understood why your state gets bashed so, so much. Are there flaws? Sure, but find me a state that has none, I’ll wait. 

Your reputation for being rude and snarky is very unfounded, in my experience. I have met some of the nicest people since moving here and people were always happy to hear that I chose to move here. Whereas so many other states would just pretentiously call you an obnoxious transplant while playing gatekeeping Olympics. 

People who say you guys are rude seem to always forget that there are fucking rude people anywhere you go, you guys just happen to be the most densely populated state; so you’re gonna find some dense populations of assholes but that is literally just society as a whole. With amazing people must come not so amazing people. Yin and Yang, if you will.

This state has a perfect blend of so many things someone could want. Near two major metropolitan cities with so much to offer, iconic and fun beach towns, a variety of cuisines (and some of the best I’ve had for that matter). People are efficient here and don’t take shit which I have huge admiration for, fuck da haters.

People here have even asked why I would ever move from Vermont to here and it just baffles be because they’re two completely different states and have amazing qualities in their own unique ways. Take it from a transplant, you guys are all right in my book 👌🏼

Edit: it’s my duty to say this as a NJ resident. Read every single one of the comments saying how much it sucks here, it’s true. Please don’t come here. It’s spooky and scary and you’ll have a much cleaner and safer experience if you move to NYC. They’re right in describing NJ as Gotham.

I picked a town 15 min outside of Portland. Quiet, no traffic, nobody flipping the jersey state bird, and not one horn blown. Had no problem finding work. Food scene is actually dynamite, not the pizza or bagels though.

But the housing crisis is a thing up here just like jersey.  Old ass houses going for well over there intended value because all the Massholes came up and scooped up second homes for cash. Sounds pretty familiar (i.e. NY'rs coming to NJ).

But what really got me was the sense of humor up here. Or lack there-of. No sarcasm (jerseys second language), dry, vanilla/plain type people. Almost """"too"""" boring. Kind but not nice, is a thing up here. It was easier to make friend with transplants than it was actual locals.

The pay scale is not that great up here also. I'm in construction and it seems like they're about 10-15 yrs behind on the rest of the nation. Portland and surrounding towns are charging Hoboken prices to live here. So if you want to get a house under 400k, on at least an acre, you have to look almost an hr plus away from portland. Which puts you in the middle of trailer city. Property taxes aren't as much but pretty dam close.

Also the amount of racism is astounding.  2nd week up here some kkk group marched through Portland and noone did or said anything. Then the lewiston shooting. A shooting on 95 a couple months prior to lewiston. 

So my point is that.. the grass isnt always greener, only their weed is. I miss the diversity, my social life, distance to NYC/PHILLY/SHORE/MOUNTAINS. Now I'm on the road trying to get back into jersey, and I couldn't be happier.

I miss the jerkoffs of our state, and I never thought I'd feel that way.","NewJersey","Moved out... moving back",178.0,641.3,"Culture and Recreation","2024-11-13T04:04:01.130893Z","https://www.reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1b1be50/moved_out_moving_back/"

The governor’s visit to Sulphur was nothing further than ceremonial. Whatever. The thing that bothered me was that he was accompanied by Ryan Walters. RYAN WALTERS does NOT care about Sulphur. In fact, he hates every Oklahoman that he saw the day he visited. 
Sulphur is a small community that doesn’t require or ask for much, but remains sufficient with the help of state taxes just like any other rural town. It’s not Moore or Norman. It’s not Tulsa or even Lawton. Sulphur is not a destination. It’s grassroots. 
Ryan Walters went to Sulphur and pretended that he cares about a place like Sulphur. Ryan Walters’ goal is to destroy the public school system. There is now a Veritas school in Sulphur that is part of that plan. It’s a plan to create a Christian Nationalistic future. It’s an avenue for wealthier families to get a tax break if they choose Veritas that is created in order to mold children to be the future Christian Nationalist leaders in their weird dream world where groups are easier to marginalize. It’s dystopian. 
I love Oklahoma, but I left because of these people. They DO NOT care about you. They don’t want to help. Ryan Walters and Stitt probably couldn’t wait to bathe when they got back to OKC just from shaking hands with the residents of Sulphur. It’s sad that Oklahoma is only second to Tennessee in regressive legislation and attitude toward humanity and that is proven time and time again by ballot. 
I hope that it can turn around. It’s embarrassing and trust me when I say that people all over the country roll their eyes at Oklahoma’s politics. 
Ryan Walters is just as weird as Stitt. Awful. I wish for the best, but it’s never showed any chance of getting better.

Project 2025 will negatively affect each American equally. Trump WILL implement Project 2025 if he is elected president.

I really hope you take the time to read as much as you can on Prikect 2025. It's super important for every American to know what will happen if this gets implemented through the Trump administration. For those who say Trump doesn't have anything to do it. What's written and sourced below shows otherwise.

Here's a list of Heritage Foundation's(Project 2025 authors) 2016 recommendations. Trump adopted 64% of them. 

https://www.scribd.com/document/369820462/Mandate-for-Leadership-Policy-Recommendations

And here's a video of Trump giving a speech at a Heritage Foundation meeting two years ago where he outright says on video, """"this is a great group and they're gonna lay the groundwork and detailed plans for exactly what our movement will do.""""

https://youtu.be/6q8gz_Kd7KI?si=LvdBI9NEcmGFOIL9

Why does this matter? Take a look for yourself! What matters to you? This website has you pick the topic that matters to you and shows you what page number your topic is on and what will happen if Project 2025 is implemented under a  Trump regime. None of it is good for America.

Chatbot explaining Project 2025

https://preventproject2025.com/

Project 2025 plans to cut Medicaire and Medicaid. If implemented, it plans to jail women who get abortions pills or use contraceptives. (Which their hand was shown when the Republicans denied even a VOTE that would protect access to birth control. I wonder why that is.) 

It wants to outlaw IVF. When using IVF and an embryo is considered a """"person"""" or """"fetal personhood"""" to the Evangelicals. Alabama has already begun the process of eliminating IVF. Why? Because providers fear that """"our patients and our physicians could be prosecuted criminally or face punitive damages for following the standard of care for IVF.""""

https://www.reuters.com/world/us/three-alabama-providers-halt-ivf-after-high-court-rules-embryos-are-children-2024-02-22/#:~:text=The%20University%20of%20Alabama%20at,of%20care%20for%20IVF%20treatments.%22

It would strip away one of the tenets of our country, seeking asylum. It would deport immigrants through raids. You know?! Like Hitler did with the Jews.

It would give executive power to surveillance on citizens. Which is ALWAYS good if Trump, a sociopath who wants vengeance on his enemies (*cough*Hitler*cough*), gets his hand on that power. Now that the Supreme Court has declared that presidents are above the law, I'm sure nothing bad would happen there (heavvvy sarcasm).

Protesting would be done for. Federal law enforcement would have the power to arrest protestors and journalists. (*cough*Nazi Germany*cough*)

Voting will be all but obsolete. Project 2025 will abuse executive power to interfere in our elections by criminalizing the voting process and damaging fair representation. (*cough*dictatorship*cough*). 

I really to get this cough checked out.

Literally every single one of them are """"Collin Allred is bad because he supports trans people."""" Got dinner with a buddy last night at Pluckers which obviously had CFB on all the TVs, saw the commercial about the wheelchair vet hating trans people 4 times in one hour. No mention of any political issue, no mention of any policy, no mention of any goals. No mention of anything other than trans people. Why is that the complete focal point of the campaign? I mean I guess they have access to more research and data than I do, but are there really that many voters out there hanging their vote on this one single issue? 

It's so strange to me, because regardless of whatever someone's view on trans people even is, there's no way you can argue that anything going on with trans people is a major part of politics. It doesn't effect the economy, it doesn't effect public education, it doesn't effect climate and energy, it doesn't effect social welfare solutions. Why aren't they focusing on anything that will actually effect the majority of Texan's lives in any way? Like out of everything out there to talk about around election time, and especially the things republicans like beating the drum of, you'd expect at least one Cruz commercial about immigration, but there isn't even that. Just trans people, every time. 

Again, maybe I have a misread on how much this really is an issue of importance, but I do genuinely have a hard time believing it's such an election deciding issue, making the fact that all their marketing budget is spent talking about trans people really fucking weird.

Edit: Mods please don't remove republican's responses unless they're outright hate speech. I asked the question, they deserve the platform to answer or else it's just a circlejerk.

Greetings, beloved peasants of Backwoods wherever the fuck, WV! I’ve had an epiphany between my third latte and my daily TED Talk binge: Why not grace your adorable little backwater with my cosmopolitan presence? Yes, I've decided to descend from my high-cost urban paradise to elevate your quaint, bucolic existence.

Now, I've done my Googling in between online Pilates sessions, and I understand that your economy might be quaintly focused on """"outdoor activities"""" and """"craftsmanship."""" How delightfully archaic! Well, prepare yourselves for a renaissance, as I plan to introduce you to the wonders of telecommuting, artisan coffee shops on every corner, and maybe even a Whole Foods if you're lucky.

Let’s break down how I will magnanimously uplift your local culture and economy:

1. **Cultural Enlightenment**: It's adorable how you engage in local festivities and community gatherings. I can't wait to elevate these with a touch of urban sophistication. Think less square dancing, more silent disco. Less potluck, more curated, farm-to-table dining experiences. You'll thank me later.
2. **Economic Overhaul**: With my remote tech job's salary, I'll single-handedly gentrify—oops, I mean """"revitalize""""—your cute little town. I foresee a future where your quaint mom-and-pop shops transform into chic boutiques and co-working spaces. You're welcome in advance.
3. **Real Estate Revolution**: I've been informed your """"affordable housing"""" means I can buy up half the town for the price of my tiny urban studio. I'll start with the charming farmhouse on the outskirts—don't worry, I'll keep the exterior for Instagram. The inside? Obviously, it'll be gutted for a mid-century modern makeover.
4. **Tech Invasion**: Lastly, I’ll drag your adorable hamlet into the 21st century. High-speed internet isn't just for city slickers; even you should know the joy of streaming Netflix without buffering. And don't get me started on smart homes. Alexa will be your new best friend, I promise.

So, how do we ensure my arrival is met with the fanfare it rightly deserves? I expect a welcome committee (local artisanal gifts preferred) and a guide on how to avoid any minor inconveniences (I can't stand potholes). Let's work together to ensure my transition into your lives is as seamless as my cashmere sweaters.

With all the love and generosity one can muster,

Your Future Savior","WestVirginia","I'm sick of just being """"middle class"""" in my HCOL area, I want advice so I may grace you bumpkins with my presence and get a taste of the high life?",65.0,234.3,"Other / Uncategorized","2024-11-13T06:39:53.240115Z","https://www.reddit.com/r/WestVirginia/comments/1b78poq/im_sick_of_just_being_middle_class_in_my_hcol/"

""""About a week ago, people on Twitter started making maps of their states with the logos/mascots of all the public high schools in each of the counties in their states. I was inspired, but waited patiently to see if someone would do Alabama (so I could steal it and print it for a poster in my classroom!) I never saw someone make one for Alabama, so I took it upon myself to create this masterpiece! Every single public high school in the state of Alabama (according to homes.com). I got pictures of logos/mascots from school websites, social media, and MaxPreps. At some point I’ll get around to moving the logos to their correct geographic location within the counties, but this was hard enough already! If you have a personal connection to any of these schools, let me know if I used the wrong logo or accidentally excluded it and I will update it. 💪🏻

A city council meeting was held last night. There was a lot of answered questions and a lot of not answered questions. 

What we know- 

Our city has three wells. Two are down and one is pumping 10-25 gallons a minute instead of the normal 500-600. 
A new pump has been built and is being delivered, it should be here by next week. 
A portion of 2 million dollars of the 6 million dollar grant will be released to make sure our city leaders are doing what they say they would with the money. 
A complete overhaul of our water system is needed, we have cast iron pipes and there has been no updates since 1960. 
There could be a hole in the piping allowing air to come through. Thus allowing dirt and other contaminates as well. 
Our water is not being tested hourly right now as we don’t have the equipment to do that. 
No meters in town are working, so instead of charging you what you owe for water, they’re taking the amount owed to the water company and dividing it between citizens. They’re charging us what they want to charge us. 

What we don’t know-

Why it’s taken so long to get the ball rolling if this has been an issue for so many years. 
Why there was no clean water passed out among citizens. The last two days there have been water passed out, yet our water has been contaminated since Christmas Day. 
We can’t connect to county water until our water is tested and they’re compatible. 
We don’t know what has been done with past grants, and the questions to where money was spent at the city meeting last night yielded no answers. 

They promised communication at the meeting, yet just this morning a boil order was issued by ADEM and we had to find out via Facebook. 


I want to personally thank the councilman from Tuscaloosa that came to talk to our leaders last night, and everyone who came that wasn’t from Marion to help get us some answers. 

Hopefully with so many eyes on this something will be fixed soon. 

My personal opinion? Mayor Hinton and a lot of elected officials are in over their heads. I don’t think they know where to begin on this issue and I don’t think they’re willing to accept that they need help finding where to start. The county brought in an engineer too assess what needed to be done, but I think a 3rd party engineer needs to do an assessment. The county engineer is a conflict of interest as he has the county’s best interest at heart, and the county is known to have a bad relationship with Marion. 

Please continue to pray for us. Please continue to share the news you see. Hopefully there will be more press in the days to come to help hold our leaders to their word.

“The book explores how slavery came to exist and persist in Alaska despite the federal act that banned it and examines the Tlingit, Haida and Tsimshian property laws that Native and some non-Native people believed preempted the United States’ constitutional edicts. The Tlingit also asserted they were a sovereign nation and not subject to the laws of the United States.

The practice of slavery was widespread in the region. Early Russian fur traders noted that many Tlingit slaves were Flathead Indians who had been enslaved and traded far up the coast. Individuals were enslaved as far north as Dena’ina territory, which encompasses the Cook Inlet region and present- day Wasilla, Palmer and Anchorage, and trafficked south to the Chugach on the Kenai Peninsula, the authors wrote.

Though reliable data is sparse, most estimates put the presence of slaves between ten and thirty five percent of most Northwest Coast populations.”

I would always get the salmon and it was slimy and not as good as normal.  So tonight my MIL wanted to go for her birthday and we went and it was awful. I got the seafood chowder and it was super bland and not any seafood in it that I could tell. So I only took a couple spoons of it. Then my entree was the big fish penne and the 5 shrimp in it were tiny and there was no flavor to it. It tastes like plain pasta even though there was a lobster sauce on it. I could not taste anything from the sauce. I decided to try the Apple Cobbler dessert and it was all crisp and a couple apple slices.

But as all companies are these days (so it seems) we're _incorporated_ right here in DE.

Long story short my CEO is coming in in a few weeks for some administrative in-person stuff in court. Just for kicks after he mentioned it in an all hands call (he didn't say where but I've seen our filings, I know """"court"""" meant Wilmington) I DM'd him, thanked him for the work he did turning the company around, and offered, as the only employee living in DE, to buy him lunch after his court date. (I have met him maybe once before but he at least knows who I am, he called out some work I did a few months back on another all hands.) _He said yes_ to my complete surprise.

So now...I'm trying to figure out where to get sandwiches that isn't like overly fancy (so not like Harry's Savoy) but also not greasy spoon (so probably not Lucky's either, much as I like their stuff and maybe that _wouldn't_ be the worst idea?). Being around the riverfront or maybe on 202, right off 95, is probably best, I don't want to have him drive all over New Castle County. Trolley Square maybe?

Many of these businesses have failed for the same reason, so I thought maybe it would be helpful if someone who's been watching this game on the sidelines for several years would share their insights.

**Are you Sure?**

When you imagine having your own business, is it doing the work, or having the shop, or imagined social accolades for being a local small business owner? If the dream isn't the work of it, it's probably best to keep this a fantasy.

**The Idea**

I know that many people open the 'business of their dreams' and that they really want to run a coffee shop, or a book store, or a bakery, that they have an idea in mind. And I think having a strong idea that you've designed out in your head is important. 

But. 

I strongly recommend that you spend 6 months in your small town getting out there and talking to people. Participate in local Facebook groups. Join the rotary. Sit in on city council meetings. Donate your time to some sort of universally liked cause like animals. All good ways to find out what the town wants, who they support, and why they support them. Also, being a known value means you will probably get more support than if you just hang out your shingle.

The reality I see is that many of the ideas are informed by city life. While some city trends do eventually make it out to the sticks, some never do. (Boba tea in particular seems to be a huge deal in cities. I do not know what it is, nor have I ever seen it. Someone tried to start a boba tea thing, and it tanked in a week. No one else knew what it was, and no one was that curious either.) Be careful about that.

Other ideas are informed by what fellow retirees want. In general, that's a bit of a problematic demographic for businesses, because of the fixed income and general desire for something that is very often a dying model for a business outside of a very few niche locales.

It is best to stay flexible with your idea by simplifying it. """"I want to run a coffee shop where people can sit down and enjoy the rainy days, and check out boardgames, and linger."""" can turn into """"I want to create a non-alcoholic third space in my town."""" """"I want to run a witchy tarot shop"""" can turn into """"I want to create a space for alternative people in the town."""" """"I want to run a fine dining establishment"""" .... actually, I'll unpack that one in detail.

Fine Dining establishments tank left and right in small towns. If you really dedicate yourself to watching what's going on, you'll see that many restaurants have a """"nice night' several times a year where they serve upmarket food like prime rib, porterhouse steaks, etc. Some places also have a more upscale summer menu and otherwise serve plainer food. The truth is there's simply not enough demand for this type of restaurant in a smaller town. 

*Math: if a dining establishment has only a dozen tables, and let's say they can sit an average of 36 people total, and each table is there for about 2 hours, then if they open at five and close the kitchen at 8 on a weeknight, they need 72 people per evening to be busy. let's say they are only open Thursday through Sunday, and they have a Sunday Brunch service and a Saturday Lunch service which can also serve about 72 people each, so that's 432 diners served per week. Let's say there are 15,000 people in a string of co-located small towns. Let's say 10k of those people are in a position to patronize the restaurant. That's 4% of the available public per week. Every single person in town who could go, would have to go, no less than twice a year to keep the business busy. That's a surprisingly large ask.*

***Stay Flexible with your Idea!***

**Business Hours**

I wasn't really sure where to put this section, but I realized that many people's ideas involve them continuing to work banker's hours. While this can work in touristy spots during the touristy season for that spot, it generally sets people up to fail. There are several stores I'd like to patronize in my town that are open almost exclusively during the hours I, and most everyone else, works. And they close for lunch. 

This could work, again, during touristy season, but in general, shops and restaurants need to be open when people can patronize them. Which is evenings and weekends. If that's not when you want to work, you either need a new idea or you need to hire people. But honestly, if you aren't prepared to work the hours you want to be open, that's going to be a problem, because that's when people will want or need to talk to the owner/manager.

**Skillsets**

Please think about your own skillset and the skillset you need to make the business work. If you haven't managed a retail service business or a restaurant in the last ten years (and especially if you never have) you are going to run into a lot of early problems, and you may run afoul of the law, too. Are you prepared to take classes, work for free at a similar business to learn the ropes, and also have some expensive mistakes? You need to be.

Please also think about the skillsets you need to hire, and more importantly, train. This has been a critical point of failure for many small businesses in my locality. There's a genuine belief that """"anyone"""" can cook/run a register/clean properly. But there's no such thing as an unskilled job. There is unskilled labor (I had to explain how to make change in the last few years) but there is no unskilled job. You can train certain things to an acceptable level of proficiency fairly quickly, but training still needs to happen.

Better skillsets cost more. A lot more than most people imagine. In some cases, they may not be available, and you'll need to go without or do it yourself, or bring someone in who has that skillset and wants a serious change of pace.

A special note on computers and mobile devices. Pretty much every business now has a technology angle. If you do not want to deal with phones or computers, hang it up now. 

**The Staff**

In almost every case, people have to hire some folks for their business. In almost every case I hear the small businesses bitch, moan, whine, and complain about this aspect. This is a problem on many fronts, but let's just talk about staff just now.

1. If your business is open  primarily or just significantly during school hours, it is unlikely to be a job that you can advertise as 'for teenagers.' 
2. Speaking of teenagers, pretty much no one is allowing their kids to work in a kitchen or bar past 11pm, even if it is legal. You will NOT find a 16 year old to run your dishwasher for 8 bucks an hour plus tips on Friday night. It's simply not going to happen. 
3. If your business is open during school pick-up and drop off (we don't necessarily have busses due to funding issues and driver scarcity) it is unlikely you will be able to tap into SAHMs as a resource.
4. For that matter, don't assume that your fellow retirees or transplants want to work.
5. If your business pays less than the average starting wage between the nearest McDonalds and Walmart, you will be unlikely to attract decent labor. Life in small towns used to be cheaper, but it certainly isn't now.
6. If you refuse to hire anyone who isn't squeaky clean, you will struggle to find and keep staff. 
7. If you expect staff to work as hard as you do, you probably aren't ready to run a business. It's not their baby, it's not their profit, and it's not their life. Think about how  hard you worked at your lowest point of productivity and expect that as the bare minimum an employee will do. Be honest about what that looked like.
8. Don't assume that small town values = out dated values. People will absolutely notice if your FOH staff is all cute blonds, and they will talk.
9. Straight wages (no PTO, no benefits) is fine for 20 hours or less each week, but anyone working more needs more. Do better and give it to them.
10. Staff will probably not do the shit job, or if they do, it won't be done the way you want it done. Being the owner tends to mean doing more of the worst work, not less of it.

***Whatever you don't like about staff in the places you've been will also be a problem with the staff you get unless you make a point of being a good place to work.***

**Money**

The biggest question to ask yourself is """"can you afford to fail?""""

If the answer is no, do not start the business. Even in large cities that can support an idea, well over 50% of businesses fail. I'd say that close to 90% of businesses fail in small towns.

If you can't afford to pay staff a living wage, if you can't afford any benefits for full time staff, if you have to work 70 hours a week for free to make things work.... don't start the business.

If you have to take a loan larger than your house value, don't start the business.

***Rescale it, rework the idea, change the hours, etc, etc, etc, until the money works, or don't start the business. You have a much higher than average chance of failing in small town.***

**Don't win at someone else's expense**

My town needed a second-hand shop. We got one. We liked it at first. 

It failed because we all rapidly realized that they were going around to all the charity shops/rummage sales run by the churches, grabbing the good stuff and dramatically marking it up. The  town viewed the shop, quite rightly, as robbing the poorest people in town of the opportunity to have nicer things, and that did not go over all.  

**Accept the Verdict from the Court of Public Opinion with Grace**

Let's go back to the Boba Shop. The owner, when they realized they had no customers,  started a public meltdown in the local FB pages. They were begging people to come try their product. It was not a good look, and, as I recall (though this may not be bang on, since it was a couple years ago and I didn't care that much) someone finally wrote out everything wrong with the business on their posts. They were only open from 9am to 3pm, which realistically meant that more people could only go get their product during lunch. The menu started at ~12 dollars and went up from there, which at the time was equivalent to an hour of work at most businesses. They had set up shop where there was little to no parking nearby, but they also weren't really located in the 'walking district.' At the end of the week they basically told people to 'please come enjoy some free product on me, because I don't really want all this food to rot.' 37 people showed up to try the product for free. I do remember a post in which they kinda chewed out the town for not having more interest in the business, where they shouted that people wouldn't even take it for free.

The town just did not want Boba. Or if they did, not at that price. The owner basically drove themselves out of town with their antics. 

And it was avoidable. As I understood it, people had strongly suggested that they not open the shop, that there was not enough interest. People had strongly suggested that they open during tourist season, because they would get city tourists who would patronize the shop and potentially drive curiosity (because if it's hopping, you might start to wonder why.) People strongly suggested that they do a big free giveaway on their first day or so, or some sort of BOGO deal so people could try to product, since it was novel to most if not all of us. But the owner ignored the court of public opinion at every turn, and that really sunk their ship.

***If the town doesn't like your first idea, if you handle that with grace, they may like your second idea. If you don't handle it with grace, you will probably find yourself iced out of public life. Accept the verdict early and easily.***

**A note on 'theme'**

I can't believe I have to say this, but having a California theme is not going to win you customers. I would suggest no theme at all. But if you must have one, do not have a """"California Beachside"""" theme complete with surfboard and California names for all your products. 

**The Better Idea**

A lot of the ideas I hear from recently arrived persons are very *aesthetic* when small towns really need *basics*.  If you were a mechanic, plumber, contractor, esthetician, childcare specialist, teacher, CDL, machinist, welder, appliance repairman, nurse, doctor, vet, or many of these other types of jobs, consider setting up shop as a part-timer, or joining an outfit as a part-timer. Very often having these types of skills will allow you to set your own hours, and people will tolerate having some over none.","Idaho","So you want to start a business in smalltown Idaho...",175.6,316.3,"Economy and Finance","2024-11-13T06:49:49.787426Z","https://www.reddit.com/r/Idaho/comments/1fc3d9n/so_you_want_to_start_a_business_in_smalltown_idaho/"

Misoprostol is one of the top emergency medicines used for hemorrhage during childbirth. It's literally one of the WHO's essential medications they recommend that every clinic in the world should have. It's used for other things too, including sometimes abortion care in places where that's legal.

Louisiana is making misoprostol a """" controlled dangerous substance"""", so that providers delivering babies will have to wait for it to come from somewhere else in the hospital, rather than having it immediately on hand. (It's basically like saying you can't keep your Epi-Pen on you, but rather you have to go get it from a pharmacy *after* you start having an allergic reaction.)

This is so insanely dangerous it's hard for me to imagine how this made it through the Louisiana legislature. Abortion is already banned in Louisiana!

They can afford to do it differently. There is a grant that helps pay for people to get rid of their overboard discharge situations. But they have been doing this for decades.  Our other neighbors found toilet paper floating around and looked into the state DEP site and found out why.
I feel I need to take action. We've been swimming in there for years without knowing. It is a disgrace and feels disgusting. They sit on their deck watching us swim!
Should I suggest they apply for the grant or just go straight to concrete?

Update:  thanks for all this input. I have since been back to the DEP website and found a map that shows all the overboard discharge systems in the whole town. There are a surprising number of them.
It shows that this particular system has been removed. I guess that's good but still I wonder where that toilet paper came from. Maybe a boat or someone else's OBD system that is still active.

* The cost of living has skyrocketed. Homes have skyrocketed. I will never be able to afford a home in the neighborhood I grew up in. And I will never be able to afford any house in this state.
* None of my friends/ acquaintances from my high school and college graduating classes that still live in Massachusetts have kids. And I am late 20s/early 30's.
   * Those that do have kids moved either to New Hampshire or Maine. Most have left New England entirely.
   * Most of my the people in my graduating class that still live here are still living with roommates while hitting 30. Not a great environment to raise a family in.
   * Ironically, the ones with the best life appear to have given up on a """"normal life"""" entirely, and now travel the country in a van or truck camper, working remotely. They also do not plan to have kids.

In other words: Massachusetts may still be #1 in education but what's the point if younger generations can't even consider having kids here because of cost?

The question contains two main provisions. The first bans non-citizen voting in Missouri elections, which is already impossible under state and federal law. The voting provision precedes a ban on voting systems commonly referred to as “ranked choice voting.”

The question, which the court ultimately ruled is fair and accurate, asked Missouri voters whether they wanted to:

Make the Constitution consistent with state law by only allowing citizens of the United States to vote
Prohibit the ranking of candidates by limiting voters to a single vote per candidate or issue
Require the plurality winner of a political party primary to be the single candidate at a general election
Notably, when asked in court whether non-citizens can currently vote in Missouri, attorneys defending the ballot language would not give a definitive answer
“.The court doubts whether the defendants or their counsel actually believe that non-citizens are currently allowed to vote,” Walker wrote in his judgment. “In fact, Missouri currently has statutes that prohibit non-citizens from voting in public elections.”

The lawsuit, brought by two Missouri voters, argued that because the ballot question failed to inform voters that non-citizens are already not allowed to vote, it is fundamentally misleading.

Walker determined that the ballot language “is not untrue or partial, and it does not use language that is intentionally argumentative or likely to create prejudice for the measure nor does it incorrectly describe SJR78.”

At 6’4”, it’s not easy to get down on the ground, or to get back on my feet again! My name literally means “small”.  I’ve always smiled at the humor in that, but perhaps the meaning rings true in that I readily notice the little things. Don’t get me wrong, I do love the grand landscapes that Montana has to offer, but I cherish the tiny scenes that would be easy to trample with my big ol’ feet. I saunter through the forest very carefully so as not to disturb the miniature landscapes far below me. I often walk smack dab into spider webs because I am always looking down. Pro-tip: if we’re ever walking through the woods together, walk behind me and you’ll never have to worry about webs in your face! Anyway, back to the tiny, underfoot land of mushrooms and fairies. 

I was wandering through the woods the other day, near Swan Creek in the Gallatin Mountain Range. Now, I have never seen a fairy, but I suspect they’ve seen me!  The same wind that chased the clouds across the sky, had the pine trees swaying with mesmerizing motions. The gentle roar of a gust would start faintly in the distance and then crescendo above me before softly disappearing into the woods. I was wondering at the play of light and shadows that all of this arial drama created on the forest floor, when I spotted this delightful scene near the tip of my boot. A small tilted flat stone sloped towards a mushroom that was about 2 inches tall. Just enough height to offer a forest fairy shelter from either rain or bright sunlight. In fact, I’m not so certain that the rustling I heard in the long mosses wasn’t a fairy or two making sure I meant them no harm. 

I placed my camera gently on the ground, taking care not to crush any plants. I propped the lens up a bit with a small segment of tree branch laying nearby. I immediately noticed the shadow of the mushroom being cast onto the rock. A bit of warm sunlight was being transferred through the cap and onto the gills underneath. Another bit of sunlight snuck around the cap and cut across the stem of the mushroom before settling onto the rock. In the background, an ephemeral shaft of light, illuminated the background and drove my imagination crazy wondering if I’d heard fairy music and soft giggling or just the song of a distant warbler along the creek bank. The next moment, the light had changed, and the magic moved on to another location in the forest.","Montana","A Resting Spot for Fairies",47.3,222.0,"Culture and Recreation","2024-11-13T06:45:08.063275Z","https://i.redd.it/duhkc41rmtld1.jpeg"

In Wendell Berry’s essay, A Native Hill, he shares these thoughts on the difference between a road and a path. 

“The difference between a path and a road is not only the obvious one. A path is little more than a habit that comes with knowledge of a place. It is a sort of ritual of familiarity. As a form, it is a form of contact with a known landscape. It is not destructive. It is the perfect adaptation, through experience and familiarity, of movement to place; it obeys the natural contours; such obstacles as it meets it goes around.”

By this definition and despite my mode of transportation, this road is much more of a path. My knowledge of this place has not dimmed my sense of wonder for it. Even though I know by loving memory what view may appear around the next corner, I am drawn inexorably to experience it again. Wendell proposes that roads resist the landscape and wish to avoid contact with it. Not so with this primitive road. It chooses to embrace the landscape as it carries my love for wild places and starry night skies deeper into the terrain. I’m not sure why anyone would resist the pull of any type of path that carries them away from hurry and towards the solace the natural world has to offer.

Friends, sharing this here because my partner's Dad went missing on vacation. Stan has been missing since early Friday morning (8/16/24). He left without shoes or his phone, and we're greatly concerned for his wellbeing. Please be on the lookout if you are in/near Hilton Head, and share with anyone who may be in the area. Please call (843) 524-2777 with any information.

If you drive from Columbia to Nashville it’s all starting to blend together. Franklin, springhill, Columbia, Murfreesboro, nolensville is all just suburban sprawl for miles and they’re building more and more and more. It’s starting to creep to our rural areas with these subdivisions popping up and I feel like one day a great majority of our farms and forests will be gone to houses shoved right on top of each other. I also never hear any politician speak about this problem, instead many encourage people to move here. We at least need some sort of zoning county wide that leaves some counties as pure farming/industry/resource based and the others to have their suburban sprawl so it doesn’t spread throughout the entire state. I honestly don’t know how something like this ever gets fixed, it’s corporations that are buying the land and building left and right everywhere you look.

I’m making $15.75 an hour and I’m struggling. Even with low rent, I’m struggling. I look around for jobs, granted I only have a diploma, and it’s just all low paying shit, man. There seems to be no opportunity, here. 

I’m well traveled. From Dallas to NYC to Miami and Chicago, and all sorts of places in between. 

And it breaks my heart that all of these places I’ve been— just seem better than West Virginia. Besides Michigan and maybe St. Louis, everywhere I go, I just think to myself: “Man, this is better than West Virginia”. And I hate that. It hurts. 

My family is here. My friends are here. My heart is here. These hills are so beautiful, and the skies are painted with a feeling of comfort. 

I was driving home from Indiana the other day, had just come from Illinois. I remember thinking: “Man, there’s just so much more out here than West Virginia”, and I was honestly feeling bittersweet about entering the WV state line. Bitter was the feeling that I was going back to the place that had so little, that I felt stuck in. Sweet was the feeling of finally being home in the hills, where my heart lie. 

I don’t know what to do. I think I need to prepare to say goodbye to West Virginia. 

Edit: I just want to say, I really appreciate all the comments being left on this post. Leave it to West Virginians to be so kind. Its hard coming to terms and realizing that I’m eventually going to have to up and leave. I have $1,000 of debt to pay off, and after that— it’s time to buckle down and start spreading my wings to fly away. Thank you all, seriously. I needed the kind words and the encouragement.

I have 3 young daughters, so most of the time my wife and I use rope and kayaks to tow 2 of them in tubes, the other is solo on a kids kayak.    We have probably done this 50+ times at this point and generally speaking we know what we’re doing and are not total morons…….most of the time

If anyone knows Great Cacapon well, we planned to take out at the low water bridge on Rockford Road.   Wed put in at our community access point about 4 miles up river, planning on around a 2 hour float with some time built in for swimming and general leisure.   There were potential storms in the forecast but we thought we had PLENTY of time.   

Well, long story short, we did not.   Basically, we were within a half mile of my truck, and were all basically paddling as fast as we could when Armageddon hit us.   My 2 oldest daughters were completely panicked and my wife and youngest daughter, who were around 30-40 yards behind us when the first drops came, were now nowhere to be seen.   This was a SERIOUS thunderstorm and it came quick and furious. 

So my 8 year old is in a state of absolute panic and I’m trying to keep everyone calm while we’re paddling for shore.   Out of nowhere (couldn’t really see anything beyond 100-120 ft or so) an ATV rolls right up to the river bank, and a guy is yelling at top of his lungs and motioning us in.    I was headed for the riverbank anyways, but with no plan for shelter other than getting under a tree.   I just knew I had to get my kids out of the water, and then find my wife and youngest immediately.   I was almost certain about where my wife would’ve put in and gotten out of the water to try to ride it out, but since I didn’t see them do it myself I was panicked.

Guy on the ATV gets my kids and I up to a covered barn area about 50-60 yards from the bank of the river, where his wife and kids are waiting for us with towels.   She had apparently seen us out on the water and they sprung into action.   

So we get a very warm welcome and greeting but they can see how frantic we are and I immediately tell them I have to go find my wife.   I cannot emphasize enough how severe the storm was at this point.   Blinding sheets of rain, thunder booming all over the place.   As soon as I say this, the guy is immediately back on his ATV racing to where I thought they might be, with me pretty much running after him.

This is where it gets ridiculous (if it wasn’t already).   We get around 200 yards down the road (he’s now pretty well ahead of me)….and as he zooms by my wife and youngest daughter come walking out from the thin strip of woods that’s between the river and Rockford Rd.   It was raining so hard and was so loud that the guy on the ATV couldn’t hear me yelling for him that we’d found them, so he had kept going.    

My wife is obviously shaken, my 5 year old is hysterical…..so I carry my 5 year old back to the barn where this unbelievably nice family is still waiting with my other 2 kids, keeping them warm and just being overall as kind as  humanly possible.  

So now I have my whole family safe and sound, but this guy doesn’t know this so he is out on the ATV in beyond hellish conditions looking for my family.   I’m like “I gotta go back out to tell him everything’s OK”, and his wife just refuses to let me do that.  “He’s already wet”, and “this is fun to him” we’re here lines I believe.

Thankfully he came back before long, just laughs at what had happened and him being yards past when my wife had popped out by the roadside, and then offers to take me to get my truck!   I’m really in no position to say no, so we drive down to bridge, he drops me off, I get my truck to take back to where my family was, and as I’m pulling off the road I see that this man has GONE BACK DOWN TO THE RIVER AND CARRIED OUR 2 KAYAKS BACK UP TO THE ROADSIDE!!

Then, and I swear to God I’m not making this up, he asks if we drink, we say hell yes, and gives us a pull from his Peach Crown (was damn good).

After we actually properly introduced ourselves, we discovered that it was Robert (Bub) on the ATV and Brittany was the angel with the towels and smiles who stayed with my kids while I was frantically looking for my wife.   

Bub and Brittany’s kindness, neighborliness, generosity, and willingness to go miles and miles out of their way to step out into utter misery in order to help out complete strangers for no credit or publicity whatsoever is something I honestly will never forget.   I hope I can somehow come close to paying it forward.

Thank you Bub and Brittany.   Y’all helped us out tremendously yesterday.   More importantly you taught my children a lesson about compassion and how to be a good person that I’ll make sure they never ever forget!!

**MADISON, Wis.** — A [bombshell report](https://wisdems.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=5fdce0a26f89c28febc13998d&id=cdf93e21fd&e=bc56144430) this morning from Dan Bice of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel revealed that Banco Azteca, a bank reportedly tied to the Mexican cartel flew $26 million of cash across the U.S.-Mexico Border to Eric Hovde’s bank in California.

Banco Azteca, the 10th largest financial institution in Mexico, has had its share of problems in recent years.  
  
Accused in past news stories of having links to the Mexican drug cartel.  
  
Dropped as a financial partner by some U.S. banks because of """"risk and compliance concerns.""""  
And now caught up in a Texas bribery scheme with an American congressman.  
  
But Sunwest Bank, the Utah-based financial institution run by Republican U.S. Senate candidate Eric Hovde, doesn't mind doing business with it.  
  
In December, Banco Azteca sent $26.2 million in cash to Sunwest on four airplane flights as part of a massive currency conversion called """"repatriation,"""" records show. Hovde, who is running against Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, is chairman and CEO of Sunwest.
