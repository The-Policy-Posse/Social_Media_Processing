```  

- Within the project workspace, locate the blue **"Label All Tasks"** button.

## 5. Label Policy Areas

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', results='asis', fig.align='center', fig.pos='H'}
knitr::include_graphics("label.jpg")
```  

- **Review Content:** Carefully read the **Title**, **Image**, and **Contents** (if available) of each post or comment.
