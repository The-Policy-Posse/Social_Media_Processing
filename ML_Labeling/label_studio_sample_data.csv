1bp83ax,Open Carry,"I was just in NSB and one of those open carry whackjobs came in with a pistol holstered to each hip and some sort of military surplus tactical vest on, and I noticed everyone’s eyes trained on him the entire time he was in there. 

We were all scared.

And, I guess, that’s my problem right there. If you have, through your actions, induced terror into the populace, does that not make you a terrorist? At any time he could have whipped out those guns and shot every last one of us to death.

We don’t know if he’s a “good guy.” Shit, we don’t even know if he has a permit and the guns are legal.

I just wonder, do these people WANT us to fear them? Is that what they’re hoping to elicit? Do they stroke themselves to sleep at night picturing the fear in the eyes of everyone in that bank?

I’m a lifelong Vermonter. Born and raised. I’m aware that open carry laws won’t change any time soon. I just needed to vent, I guess.

1fz29q0,Bad time living in vermont,"I know this is going to get downvoted and people are going to be mad, but I have had an extraordinarily bad time living in Vermont.

I live in Bennington and work in Sunderland. From the start, people (particularly in the northern areas) were cold and standoffish with me. Now, I lived in the Czech Republic, so cold strangers is nothing new to me, but people in VT seemed downright judgmental. When I hold the door for people a the Stewart’s in Arlington, they don’t say thank you. When I get a drink at Ramunto’s in Bennington, people stare at me like I’m some murderer. I’ve made a couple friends, but generally people are rude and make me feel unwelcomed. It’s as if they’ve never seen a new face before. When people in Manchester hear that I live in Bennington, they treat me like I’m som kind of criminal.

I’ve experienced a lot of theft as well. Again, I’ve lived in places like Detroit and Milwaukee and never had anything. In Bennington, some random person crashed into my car my car while it was parked and totaled it. When I got a new car, someone smashed the window, stole my stereo, and left cigarettes ashes everywhere. I know this can happen anywhere, but nothing as extreme has happened to me before. It’s extremely isolating. 

For the past year, I’ve been vaguely sick all the time. I’ve felt dizzy and like I couldn’t breathe properly, and my bloodwork was all messed up. Come to find out that there was a hole
in my apartment roof and the ceiling was covered in black mold. I had to go stay at a motel for a couple weeks and some asshole broke into my car and stole all my clothes. 

To add to all that, you can’t get anything without driving at least 30 minutes to an hour. Want Wendy’s? Drive to Troy. Live in Arlington and want a reasonably priced grocery store? Go to Bennington. 

Just a gripe, but people take their local town politics WAY TOO seriously. The people in Manchester spent a full two hours debating about the color of open signs outside of businesses. Like, who the fuck cares?

I moved to VT for work and I fucking regret it. My health is compromised, I’m down a full car, much of my belongings have been stolen, and I’m just sad. If you’re in your 20s/30s and you’re thinking of moving to VT by yourself for work or something, just don’t. Take a vacation and go skiing if you wish, but don’t commit to moving here.

1bp83ax,Open Carry,"I was just in NSB and one of those open carry whackjobs came in with a pistol holstered to each hip and some sort of military surplus tactical vest on, and I noticed everyone’s eyes trained on him the entire time he was in there. 

We were all scared.

And, I guess, that’s my problem right there. If you have, through your actions, induced terror into the populace, does that not make you a terrorist? At any time he could have whipped out those guns and shot every last one of us to death.

We don’t know if he’s a “good guy.” Shit, we don’t even know if he has a permit and the guns are legal.

I just wonder, do these people WANT us to fear them? Is that what they’re hoping to elicit? Do they stroke themselves to sleep at night picturing the fear in the eyes of everyone in that bank?

I’m a lifelong Vermonter. Born and raised. I’m aware that open carry laws won’t change any time soon. I just needed to vent, I guess.

Fuck that guy.",https://storage.googleapis.com/policy_posse_reddit_images/reddit_post_images/1bp83ax.jpg,https://www.reddit.com/r/vermont/comments/1bp83ax/open_carry/,1,Vermont

I'm sick to death of all these pathetic plastic pavement princesses rolling around with enemy insignia. 

Please stop and have a word, or two.

If I had to choose two, it would be fuck, and you.",https://storage.googleapis.com/policy_posse_reddit_images/reddit_post_images/1cxty52.jpg,https://www.reddit.com/r/vermont/comments/1cxty52/if_you_got_a_confederate_flag_on_your_truck_we/,1,Vermont
